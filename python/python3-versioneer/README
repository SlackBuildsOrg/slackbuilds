python3-versioneer (Easy VCS-based mgt of project version strings)

This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in
setuptools-based python projects. The goal is to remove the tedious
and error-prone "update the embedded version string" step from your
release process. Making a new release should be as easy as recording a
new tag in your version-control system, and maybe making new tarballs
