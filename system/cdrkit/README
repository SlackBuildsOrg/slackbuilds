This is a fork of the last free GPL version of cdrtools.

icedax: CD audio sampling utility (formerly cdda2wav).
wodim: burn discs in most ATAPI/SCSI CD-R drives (formerly cdrecord).
genisoimage: create ISO9660/HFS/Joliet CD-ROM images (formerly mkisofs).

CDRKit was forked from CDRTools because of an alleged license 
incompatibility that would make it impossible to distribute 
(combining GPL and CDDL code in the same binary). 
See http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK for more details, 
but note that the issue is not settled - there are arguments
that the interaction between the CDDL-licensed portion (the build
tools) and the GPL-licensed portion (the actual code) is such
that there is no license incompatibility.  We at SlackBuilds.org
are not taking a stance on that - we simply provide the build script
if you wish to use it.

This package will conflict with cdrtools - in other words, you *need*
to remove cdrtools before installing cdrkit.

This script will create symlinks for mkisofs and cdda2wav for backwards
compatibility with cdrtools and previous versions of cdrkit.
