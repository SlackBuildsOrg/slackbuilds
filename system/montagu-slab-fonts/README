Montagu Slab

Montagu Slab is a slab-serif display typeface designed by Florian
Karsten. The typeface draws inspiration from 19th-century classic
designs and it is available as a variable font with weight and optical
size axes.

The optical size axis, which controls x-height, spacing, contrast and
aperture, provides a wide range of variation â€“ from low contrast and
higher x-height version suitable for longer text, to a tight and high
contrast display variant with prominent upturned tails.
