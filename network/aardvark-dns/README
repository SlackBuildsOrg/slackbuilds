aardvark-dns - authoritative dns server for A/AAAA container records

Aardvark is a DNS server Netavark uses to service container DNS 
requests and enable containers to resolve other containers by their 
names or aliases. In CNI, the 'dnsname' plugin provides this 
functionality.

Aardvark is activated by Netavark when containers are running and
automatically exits when all containers have exited.
