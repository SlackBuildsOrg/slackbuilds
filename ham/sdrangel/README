SDR Rx/Tx software for Airspy, Airspy HF+, BladeRF, HackRF, LimeSDR,
PlutoSDR, RTL-SDR, SDRplay RSP1 and FunCube

This software project is committed to Open Source that is you as a
visitor, collaborator, simple user... will always be guaranteed access
to the source code. You may fork this repository, change the code, take
bits to use in another project or just run it. It is important to
realize that source code is THE value of this software.
Artifacts are considered as accessory.
This is NOT free software as in free lunch and when you run it a
collaborative attitude is expected.

This software is provided in the hope it will be useful. Its main goal
is to provide a Software Defined Radio platform that is committed to:

- be efficient: code should be written to be conservative on CPU
  resources it is not because the CPU power of machines constantly
  increase that this power should be wasted
- have fast paced instrumental graphics. Thanks to OpenGL spectrum,
  signal graphics and images can be rendered responsively
- give power to the user by letting him/her control all aspects of the
  DSP processing chain. But as you know with greater power comes
  greater responsibility therefore it is expected that you already have
  some experience with SDR applications and digital signal processing
  in general
- be an experimental platform for amateur radio or anyone interested in
  matters related to electromagnetism or communication based on
  electromagnetic waves. It is in no way intended for production
  moreover mission critical usage.

Depending to your SDR hardware you may want to install some or all:
libairspy, libairspyhf, libbladeRF, libhackrf, liniio, libmirisdr,
SDRplay, libperseus, librtlsdr, uhd ...
(not all available at slackbuilds.org)

Optional features can be enabled installing:
aptdec, cm256cc, dab_lib, mbelib, serialDV, dsdcc, sgp4, libsigmf,
ggmorse
