qt-6.2.4-libraries-for-musescore (Qt 6.2.4 Libraries for MuseScore)

These are the required libraries to build musescore as made
available by the Qt project, required to build MuseScore versions
4.4.0 and above.

Please consider as alternative installing these through
qt-installer-script Slackbuild and afterwards either:

a) do a manual install of Qt, selecting the libraries described in:
https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/wiki/Install-Qt-and-Qt-Creator

    basically you'll need to select these components:
    - "Desktop gcc 64-bit"
    - "Qt 5 Compatibility Module"
    - From Additional Libraries:
        "Qt Network Authorization"
        "Qt State Machines"
    - From Developer and Designer Tools:
        "Qt Creator"
        "CMake"
        "Ninja"

OR b)
    do an unattended installation using
    the "qt-6.2.4-libraries-for-musescore.sh" script provided
    with the "qt-installer-script" SlackBuild.

Note:
The "qt-installer-script" and this package and should not be
installed at the same time if Qt 6.2.4 is needed,
as they write to the same folders in /opt/Qt/6.2.4
