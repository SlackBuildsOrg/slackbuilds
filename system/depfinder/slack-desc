# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

depfinder: depfinder (finds dependencies of Slackware packages)
depfinder:
depfinder: depfinder is a tool that finds the dependencies of Slackware
depfinder: packages and outputs them in a comma separated list, in stdout or a
depfinder: .dep file. depfinder is very fast at calculating dependencies; the
depfinder: speed difference mainly comes from the C++ code that is used to find
depfinder: in which package each individual library is included. That C++ code is
depfinder: 'borrowed' (as in blatanly ripped) from Nigel Bosch's zpm code.
depfinder: depfinder also has support for running multiple jobs which makes it a
depfinder: "*lot* faster on PCs with multiple CPUs/cores.
