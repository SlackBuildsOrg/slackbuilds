OpenRazer is an entirely open source driver and user-space daemon
that allows you to manage your Razer peripherals on GNU/Linux.
OpenRazer consists of a driver, a daemon and a Python library.

In order for OpenRazer to work your user must a member of the
plugdev group. A system reboot is recommended so the user group
change takes effect, and to bind the OpenRazer driver.
You also must load the kernel module (provided with the
openrazer-kernel) with "modprobe razerkbd".

To have this module load automatically at boot time, add the
module to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local. Sometimes hot plugging your
device while openrazer-deamon is running is necessary for it to
recognize your razer device.

OpenRazer is just a backend, it doesn't provide a graphical user
interface for device configuration.
For GUI configuration there are three programs available here at SBo:

1) Polychromatic (Most feature rich, best looking, most recommended)
2) Razergenie (QT5 based GUI)
3) Razercommander (GTK3 based GUI)

For device compatibility see the projects homepage.
