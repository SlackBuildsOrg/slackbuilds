LibESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) electronic
mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as
Exim. It may be used as part of a Mail User Agent (MUA) or another
program that must be able to post electronic mail but where mail
functionality is not the program's primary purpose.  LibESMTP is
not intended to be used as part of a program that implements a Mail
Transport Agent.
