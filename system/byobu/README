Byobu is a Japanese term for decorative, multi-panel screens that
serve as folding room dividers. As an open source project, Byobu is an
elegant enhancement of the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU
Screen. Byobu includes an enhanced profile and configuration utilities
for the GNU screen window manager, such as toggle-able system status
notifications.

To convert an already running screen session to byobu, just install this
package, then run:

 CTRL-a :source /usr/share/byobu/profiles/byoburc

that's all!
