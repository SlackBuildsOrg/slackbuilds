PFFT (Parallel Fast Fourier Transform) is a software library for
computing massively parallel, fast Fourier transformations on
distributed memory architectures. PFFT can be understood as a
generalization of FFTW-MPI to multidimensional data decomposition.

This library requires an implementation of fftw supporting the
MPI-2 implementation (unsupported by the fftw package of the
Slackware distributions). If you want to build and install PFFT,
you have to replace the Slackware fftw with the alternative fftw-mpi
package available in this repository. The package openmpi is also
required dependency of PFFT, but it should be already in your system
since it is required for fftw-mpi.

At the moment the support to MPICH in place of Open MPI has not been
tested yet.
