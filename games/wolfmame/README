WolfMAME is a fork of MAME that does not allow pausing, and has other
security features which facilitate the recording of achievements in
arcade games.

Users recorded .inp files will be placed in /opt/wolfmame/inp

To speed up compilation, you may use "export MAKEFLAGS=-j4" before
building, where 4 is the number of cores on your system.

Note that ccache is used by default. To turn off ccache support, use:

  USE_CCACHE=no ./wolfmame.SlackBuild
