Birdfont is a free font editor which lets you create vector graphics 
and export TTF, OTF and SVG fonts. 
The editor has good support for both monochrome and color font 
formats. 

Version 2.33.3 is the latest can be installed in Slackware 15.0 because
earlier versions require webkit2gtk4.1. Since the build of Birdfont is
based on vala and the version 0.54 available in Slackware 15.0 does not
create the APIs for webkit2gtk 4.1, the build of version earlier than 
2.33.3 will fail.
