The PoDoFo library is a free, portable C++ library. It can parse
existing PDF files and create new ones from scratch.

As of version 1.x, the tools are no longer maintained or supported and
are not build by default. The tools can still be built by passing
BUILDTOOLS=TRUE to the build script.

Optional dependencies are cppunit and lua.
