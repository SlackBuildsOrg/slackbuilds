UEFITool is a cross-platform open source application written in C++/Qt,
that parses UEFI-compatible firmware image into a tree structure,
verifies image's integrity and provides a GUI to manipulate image's
elements.

Project development started in the middle of 2013 because of the lack
of cross-platform open source utilities for tinkering with UEFI images.

In the beginning of 2015 the major refactoring round was started to make
the program compatible with newer UEFI features including FFSv3 volumes
and fixed image elements. It's in development right now with the
following features still missing:

- Editor part, i.e image reconstruction routines
- Console UI
The missing parts are in development and the version with a new engine

will be made as soon as image reconstruction works again.
