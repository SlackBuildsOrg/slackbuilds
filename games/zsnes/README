zsnes (SNES emulator)

ZSNES is a Super Nintendo emulator programmed by zsKnight and _Demo_.
On April 2, 2001 the ZSNES project was GPL'ed and its source released
to the public. It currently runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and DOS.

The original zsnes developers' last release was 1.51, in 2007. This
build is for xyproto's fork, which is still maintained as of 2023, and
has several bugfixes and minor enhancements.

Build options (environment variables):

- AO=no - disable libao for audio output. Removes all audio output
drivers except SDL. Probably not useful.

- DEBUGGER=no - disable the built-in debugger. May give a slight speed
boost on old/slow systems.

Note to x86_64 users: zsnes can't be built for 64-bit, and it's no
longer practical to provide a static binary as was done in the past.
It should be possible to build zsnes if you install multilib, though
the SlackBuild maintainer hasn't tested this.

Note to ARM/aarch64 users: because zsnes is partially written in x86
assembly, it can't be built for ARM.
