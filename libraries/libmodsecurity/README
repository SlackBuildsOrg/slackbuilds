Libmodsecurity is one component of the ModSecurity v3 project. The
library codebase serves as an interface to ModSecurity Connectors taking
in web traffic and applying traditional ModSecurity processing. In
general, it provides the capability to load/interpret rules written in
the ModSecurity SecRules format and apply them to HTTP content provided
by your application via Connectors.
