pinball (open source pinball simulator)

The Emilia Pinball project is an open source pinball simulator
intended for Linux machines, by Henrik Enqvist.

slibtool users should use 'clibtool-shared' with pinball which will
install the libtool archive (.la) files. Pinball will fail to load any
tables when they are missing.
