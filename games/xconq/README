xconq, a classic X-based strategic wargame.

Save the world from the evil empires attempting to take
over. Multi-player over a network or single-player against the
machine. This is xconq v. 5.5.1a, the last stable version of xconq
version 5, from July of 1992.  (Later versions through v. 7.5 are
available with revamped interface.)

Options are available to set numbers and kinds of players, as well
as the map used.  In addition, xconq has extensive and elaborate
facilities for building maps, scenarios, and historical periods,
resulting in a wide variety of games. This SlackBuild builds only
the "standard" period, corresponding roughly to the mid-to late
20th century.
