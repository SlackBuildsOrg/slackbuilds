# Slackware build script for xtetris

# Written by B. Watson (urchlay@slackware.uk)

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# This is an ancient game. It used to be in Slackware, but got
# removed between 3.2 and 3.3, due to legal threats. These days,
# Slackware includes at least one tetris game (kblocks) and SBo has
# dozens of them, and nobody's threatening to sue... really this is
# of historical interest only. It does have one interesting feature
# I've never seen in another tetris game, which is the 'guide' at the
# bottom of the playing field. IMO, it makes the game a bit too easy.
# Also, the -bw mode might tickle someone's Mac Classic fancy (the Mac
# isn't a nostalgia platform for me, but it is for a lot of folks).

# The Slackware 3.2 source dir for this includes xtetris-quayle.patch,
# but the source tarball already has the patch applied, so it's not
# needed here.

# This SlackBuild is new code based on SBo template. I might have
# tried to use Pat V's ancient build script for Slackware 3.2 as a
# basis, but I couldn't find it.

# I had to patch the game a bit to get it to work properly on modern
# Slackware... but surprisingly, not all that much.

# High score file is fixed-width columns. If the local hostname is longer
# than 12 characters, the layout gets messed up, and next time you run
# the game, the high scores won't display.
# Patch truncates the hostname to 12 chars or the first . (so, use the
# short hostname, not the FQDN).
# Sorta silly to keep the hostname in the score file anyway. It
# probably originated on a network full of diskless workstations,
# where the highscore file was shared via NFS.

# This patch makes everything in the left pane a bit wider, otherwise
# the text (score, button labels, etc) gets cut off. Probably this is
# due to changes in how X renders fonts, over the last 30+ years.

# This one does two things:
# 1. Enable the window manager close button. It'll do the same thing the
#    Quit button in the UI does.
# 2. Prevent the user from resizing the window. The game looks weird
#    when resized, and even restoring the original size causes the pieces
#    that were already placed in the "well" to disappear.

# Don't run xrdb to generate the *.ad files. It fails if there's no
# X server running, or if it's running but root can't connect to it.
# To generate the *.ad files, run this script with MAKE_AD=yes in
# the env, and you probably have to run "xhost +localhost" and
# make sure DISPLAY=:0 is in the script's env, too. Then copy
# the files from $PKG/etc/X11/app-defaults to the script dir and
# commit them. Nobody but me should ever have to do that.
