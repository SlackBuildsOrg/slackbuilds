This is the C library that implements Signal's forward secrecy protocol.
The code upstream has been marked as "archived" since February 2022.

At the moment, its purpose is to enable OMEMO feature for the XMPP
client "Profanity". Should in the future "Profanity" switch to another
implementation (like "libomemo-c"), this package can be dropped.

The default is to provide a shared library. However, one can build it
statically by passing STATIC=yes:

# STATIC=yes sh libsignal-protocol-c.SlackBuild

This way you can statically link it into your final program and 
remove the library.
