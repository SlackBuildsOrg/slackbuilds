libminizip is the small library to compress and uncompress zip files
with the help of zlib.

The version of libminizip at SlackBuilds.org corresponds to the current
version of zlib on the official Slackware repository. For instance,
since Slackware 15.0 has zlib 1.2.13, libminizip on SlackBuilds.org is
also at 1.2.13.
