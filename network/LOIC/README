LOIC - the Low Orbit Ion Cannon

LOIC is an open source network attack application, written in C#. LOIC
was initially developed by Praetox Technologies, but later it was
released into the public domain

LOIC performs a denial-of-service (DoS) attack (or when used by
multiple individuals, a DDoS attack) on a target site by flooding
the server with TCP packets, UDP packets, or HTTP requests with the
intention of disrupting the service of a particular host. People have
used LOIC to join voluntary botnets.

This SlackBuild simply builds a package from the binaries. If you
would like to build it from source, you might want to consider loiq.

mono is needed to run LOIC:

  mono /opt/LOIC/LOIC.exe

A handy script /usr/bin/loic and a basic desktop integration file have
been included for ease of use.
