A high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit
database files compatible with SQLite.

DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, so you don't have to learn
complicated SQL commands.

In September 2014, this project was officially renamed "DB Browser for SQLite", or DB4S, to avoid confusion with an existing application called “Database Browser”. However, the website, Github repository, and executable retain the shortened "sqlitebrowser" name.
