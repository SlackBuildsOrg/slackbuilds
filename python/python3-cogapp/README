python3-cogapp (content generation tool)

cog lets you use small bits of Python code in otherwise static files
to generate whatever text you need.

It finds chunks of Python code embedded in input files, runs the
Python code, and inserts its output back into the original file.

This provides /usr/bin/cog.
