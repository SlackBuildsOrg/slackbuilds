# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xwit: xwit is a hodge-podge collection of simple routines to call some
xwit: of those X11 functions that don't already have any utility commands
xwit: built around them. The reasoning behind this is that loosely every X
xwit: function should be accessible from a shell script.
