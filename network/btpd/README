Btpd is a utility for sharing files over the BitTorrent network
protocol.  It runs in daemon mode, thus needing no controlling
terminal or gui. Instead, the daemon is controlled by the btcli
command line utility, or other programs capable of sending commands
and queries on the btpd control socket.

The goal is to provide a healthy alternative to the still prevailing
ftp/http servers for file distribution sites and a good BitTorrent
client for the casual user.

Features of btpd include:
    * Reasonable resource usage.
    * Runs in daemon mode; no need for constant terminal or gui.
    * Command line interface.
    * Sharing of multiple torrents in one btpd process.
    * Upload and download rate limiting.
    * IPv6 support.
    * Multitracker support.

Btpd is very simple and easy to use. The official README (which
is located in the standard documentation directory) is small and
complete, so read it first.
