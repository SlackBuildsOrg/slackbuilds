navi : An interactive cheatsheet tool for the command-line and
application launchers.

**navi** allows you to browse through cheatsheets (that you may write
yourself or download from maintainers) and execute commands. Suggested
values for arguments are dynamically displayed in a list.

#### Pros
- it will spare you from knowing CLIs by heart
- it will spare you from copy-pasting output from intermediate commands
- it will make you type less
- it will teach you new one-liners

It uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf),
[skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim),
or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) under the hood.
It can be either used as a command or as a shell widget 'Ã  la' Ctrl-R).

Running navi the first time will help you download cheatsheets.
