Livestreamer is a Command Line Interface that pipes video streams from
various services into a video player, such as VLC. The main purpose of
Livestreamer is to allow the user to avoid buggy and CPU heavy flash
plugins but still be able to enjoy various streamed content.

There is also an API available for developers who want access to the
video stream data.

Optional dependencies:

For RTMP based plugins:
    RTMPDump

For decrypting encrypted HLS streams:
    PyCrypto

For full UStream.tv support:
