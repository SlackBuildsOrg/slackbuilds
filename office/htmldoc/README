HTMLDOC converts Hyper-Text Markup Language ("HTML") input files into
indexed HTML, Adobe(r) PostScript(r), or Adobe(r) Portable Document
Format ("PDF") files. HTMLDOC supports most HTML 3.2 elements,
some HTML 4.0 elements, and can generate title and table of contents
pages. The 1.8.x releases do not support stylesheets. HTMLDOC can be
used as a standalone application, in a batch document processing
environment, or as a web-based report generation application.
No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by HTMLDOC.
