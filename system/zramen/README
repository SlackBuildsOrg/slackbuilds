Zramen is a simple bash script that makes managing zram much easier.
This SlackBuild provides the zramen script but also a service script
compatible with sysvinit. To enable it, just mark the service as
executable and you can tweak the algorithm, size, and more that
it will use in /etc/default/zramen.
