paginator (desktop pager dockapp)

paginator is a desktop pager[1] for EWMH-compliant X11 window managers
that support docked applications (dockapps), such as WindowMaker and
Fluxbox[2].

paginator shows a grid of desktop miniatures representing actual
virtual desktops; each one having window miniatures representing
actual windows. By manipulating those miniatures with the mouse,
the user can change the active window, set the desktop of a window,
and switch between desktops.

[1] Similar to FwvmPager, except it runs in a 64x64 window.

[2] The SlackBuild author has only tested this on WindowMaker. Another
    user has reported that it doesn't work properly with Fluxbox.
    Your mileage may vary.
