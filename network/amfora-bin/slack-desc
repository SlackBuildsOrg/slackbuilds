# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

amfora-bin: Amfora aims to be the best looking Gemini client with the most
amfora-bin: features... all in the terminal. It does not support Gopher or other
amfora-bin: non-Web protocols. It fully passes Sean Conman's client torture test,
amfora-bin: as well as the Egsam one.
