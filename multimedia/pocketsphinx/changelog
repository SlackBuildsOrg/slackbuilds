Updated to github commit id 8221706.
This version joins Opencv4 and lensfun
in not compiling with FFmpeg. FFmpeg will
detect pocketsphinx but it will eventually
run into error during compilation.This
seems to be FFmpeg upstream problem so
don't enable pocketsphinx in FFmpeg when
you try to recompile it.
