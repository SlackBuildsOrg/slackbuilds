ax25-apps: AX.25 Packet radio support for linux (user applications)

The AX.25 protocol offers both connected and connectionless modes of
operation, and is used either by itself for point-point links, or to
carry other protocols such as TCP/IP and NET/ROM.

It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to
make it more useful in the amateur radio environment.

This package provides specific user applications for hamradio that use
AX.25 Net/ROM or ROSE network protocols:

 * axcall: a general purpose AX.25, NET/ROM and ROSE connection
   program.
 * axlisten: a network monitor of all AX.25 traffic heard by the
   system.
 * ax25ipd: an RFC1226 compliant daemon which provides
   encapsulation of AX.25 traffic over IP.
 * ax25mond: retransmits data received from sockets into an AX.25
   monitor socket.
