makeself - Make self-extractable archives on Unix

makeself.sh is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable
tar.gz archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell
script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is. The
archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an optional
arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation script).
This is pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in
the Windows world. Makeself archives also include checksums for integrity
self-validation (CRC and/or MD5 checksums).
