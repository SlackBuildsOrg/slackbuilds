This module provides a possibility to build your own set of Moose-like
types. These custom types can then be used to describe fields in
Moo-based classes.

See MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base for a list of available base types. Its
source also provides an example of how to build base types, along with
both parameterizable and non-parameterizable.
