hyperfine (command-line benchmarking tool)

hyperfine is a sophisticated command-line benchmarking tool that
supports a variety of features, including statistical analysis,
arbitrary shell commands, formatted output and more.

Several python scripts for plotting and performing statistical analysis
on json output are installed to /usr/share/hyperfine. See
README-scripts.md in the doc directory for details. All of the scripts
are compatible with both python2 and python3. Although hyperfine itself
has no required dependencies, two runtime dependencies are needed to use
the scripts.
