# Pinner

A Geany plugin designed to enhance document management by allowing
users to pin documents to a sidebar tab. This feature is particularly
useful for users working with many multiple open documents, as it
enables them to add selected filenames to a list for easy access. Users
can then simply click on a filename in the list to switch to that
document.

The plugin will add two items to the Geany tools menu:

    Pin Document Unpin Document

The list is not persistent and will be cleared when you exit Geany. To
clear it manually, right click on it and left-click on "Clear".

## Keybindings

When the plugin is enabled, keybindings to pin and unpin documents
can be changed from the Geany preferences menu.
