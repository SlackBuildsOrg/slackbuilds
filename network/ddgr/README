ddgr is a cmdline utility to search DuckDuckGo from the
terminal. While googler is highly popular among cmdline users, in many
forums the need of a similar utility for privacy-aware DuckDuckGo came
up. DuckDuckGo Bangs are super-cool too! So here's ddgr for you!

Unlike the web interface, you can specify the number of search results
you would like to see per page. It's more convenient than skimming
through 30-odd search results per page. The default interface
is carefully designed to use minimum space without sacrificing
readability.

ddgr isn't affiliated to DuckDuckGo in any way.
