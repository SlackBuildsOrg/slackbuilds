SolidPython is a generalization of Phillip Tiefenbacher's openscad
module, found on Thingiverse. It generates valid OpenSCAD code from
Python code with minimal overhead.

Advantages Because you're using Python, a lot of things are easy that
would be hard or impossible in pure OpenSCAD. Among these are:

built-in dictionary types
mutable, slice-able list and string types
recursion
external libraries (images! 3D geometry! web-scraping! ...)
