ALIEN ARENA is a fast paced arena FPS game with multiple modes,
mutators and level, wrapped in a macabre sci-fi theme that harkens back
to the classic themes of the 1950's.

The game features 23 levels, which can be played competitively online
against other players, or practice offline against the built in AI
(bots).

Alien Arena offers Capture The Flag, All Out Assault(players can climb
into randomly spawned jetpacks to do battle), and Tactical (Alien Vs
Human in a battle to destroy the other's base by planting bombs and
other means). Simply go into the multiplayer menu to start a server,
change the game rules , and choose a map to play on.  You can also
select from a large variety of different mutators(instagib, rocket
arena, excessive, low grav, regen, vampire, etc) to further customize
your game experience.

Alien Arena : Many are called, only one will reign supreme.
