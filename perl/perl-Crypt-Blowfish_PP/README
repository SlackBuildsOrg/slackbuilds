Blowfish encryption algorithm implemented purely in Perl

The Crypt::Blowfish_PP module provides for users to use the Blowfish
encryption algorithm in perl. The implementation is entirely Object
Oriented, as there is quite a lot of context inherent in making
blowfish as fast as it is. The key is anywhere between 64 and 448
bits (8 and 56 bytes), and should be passed as a packed string. The
transformation itself is a 16-round Feistel Network, and operates on a
64 bit block.
