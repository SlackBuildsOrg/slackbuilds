bibtex2html (A translator of BibTeX bibliographies into HTML)

BibTeX2HTML is a collection of tools for automatically producing HTML
documents from bibliographies written in the BibTeX format. It
consists of three command line tools:

   - bib2bib: is a filter tool that reads one or several bibliography
     files, filters the entries with respect to a given criterion, and
     outputs the list of selected keys together with a new
     bibliography file containing only the selected entries.

   - bibtex2html: is a translator that reads a bibliography file and
     outputs two HTML documents that contains respectively the cited
     bibliography in a nice presentation, and the original BibTeX file
     augmented with several transparent HTML links to allow easy
     navigation. bibtex2html can handle any BibTeX style file,
     including those producing multiple bibliographies.

   - aux2bib: reads a .aux file as produced by LaTeX and writes to
     standard output a BibTeX file containing exactly the BibTeX
     entries refereed in the .aux file.

As part of the documentation, a manual is generated with 'pdflatex'.
For disabling generation of the manual, run:

   DISABLE_DOC=yes ./bibtex2html.SlackBuild
