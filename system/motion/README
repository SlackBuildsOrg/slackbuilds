Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more
cameras and is able to detect if a significant part of the picture has
changed. Or in other words, it can detect motion.

Motion is a command line based tool. It has no graphical user
interface. Everything is setup via the command line or via a set of
configuration files.

Once installed, please be sure to read README for any configuration
help. You will need to rename /etc/motion/motion-dist.conf to
/etc/motion/motion.conf once you have made the changes you deem
necessary.

This build has not been tested with the optional postgresql included,
but you're welcome to give it a go!

Optional dependencies are libva, ffmpeg, and postgresql.
