Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and
solving large, complicated optimization problems. It can be used to
solve Non-linear Least Squares problems with bounds constraints and
general unconstrained optimization problems. It is a mature, feature
rich, and performant library that has been used in production at
Google since 2010.
