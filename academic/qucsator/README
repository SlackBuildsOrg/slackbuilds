Qucsator is a command line driven circuit simulator.  It takes a 
network list in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs 
dataset.  It has been programmed for usage in the Qucs project but
can also be used by other applications.

Note:
For some unknown reason, qucsator only builds when using a single
job (this is the reason for the explicit '-j1' after the make
command in qucsator.SlackBuild). Please, let me know if you manage
to build it using multiple jobs.
