importlib_metadata is a library which provides an API for accessing
an installed package's metadata, such as its entry points or its
top-level name. This functionality intends to replace most uses of
pkg_resources entry point API and metadata API.

NOTE: Upstream has removed the LICENSE file from the source repo and
      I will not be updating until that situation has been resolved.
      See https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/5001 for the 
      reasons this decision should be reversed.
