Build your project with dependency lists embedded in the binaries:
cargo auditable build --release

Scan the binary for vulnerabilities:
cargo audit bin target/release/your-project

cargo auditable works with any Cargo command. All arguments are passed to cargo as-is.

To make cargo always build with cargo auditable add this to your .bashrc:
alias cargo="cargo auditable"
