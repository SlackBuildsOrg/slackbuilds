Steam is an internet-based digital distribution, digital rights
management, multiplayer, and social networking platform developed
by Valve Corporation. Steam provides the user with installation
and automatic updating of games on multiple computers, and community
features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game
voice and chat functionality.

A multilib installation is required to run steam on 64-bit Slackware.
