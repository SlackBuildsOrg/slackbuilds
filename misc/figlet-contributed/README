Contributed font set for FIGlet

This font distribution includes several fonts which were automatically
derived from other formats, and which are optionally installed by this
SlackBuild script.

To install the C64-derived fonts pass
        C64=yes
to the SlackBuild script. This will replace the default computer,
gothic and roman fonts with versions derived from C64 programs.

To install the BDF-derived fonts pass
        BDF=yes
to the SlackBuild script.

Obanner is the font of banner(6), the ubiquitous UN*X command by
Mark Horton. The default behavior is to install the Obanner font in
sizes 16, 24, 36, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 132. To install font sizes 1-132
(though sizes 1-15 are almost certainly useless), pass
        OBANNER_ALL=yes
to the SlackBuild script.
