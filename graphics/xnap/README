xnap
====

xnap is a simple and lightweight X11 utility that allows snapping the
mouse cursor to specific screen regions using keyboard shortcuts.

It is designed with minimalism in mind:
- no daemon
- no configuration files
- no background services
- small C codebase

xnap works well with lightweight and traditional window managers such as
twm, fvwm, pekwm, fluxbox, evilwm, and similar environments.

Optional Xinerama support is enabled at build time to allow proper
handling of multi-monitor setups.
