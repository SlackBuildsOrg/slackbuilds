sqlpp11 offers you to code SQL in C++ almost naturally. You can use
tables, columns and functions. Everything has strong types which
allow the compiler to help you a lot. At compile time, it will tell
about most of those pesky oversight errors you can make (typos,
comparing apples with oranges, forgetting tables in a select
statement, etc). And it does not stop at query construction.
Results have ranges, and strongly typed members, so that you can
browse through results in a type-safe manner, worthy of modern
C++.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
