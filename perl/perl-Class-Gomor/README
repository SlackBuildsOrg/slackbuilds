Class::Gomor - another class and object builder

This module is yet another class builder. This one adds parameter
checking in new constructor, that is to check for attributes
existence, and definedness. In order to validate parameters, the
module needs to find attributes, and that is the reason for declaring
attributes in global variables named @AS, @AA, @AO. They respectively
state for Attributes Scalar, Attributes Array and Attributes
Other. The last one is used to avoid autocreation of accessors, that
is to let you declare your own ones.

Attribute validation is performed by looking at classes hierarchy, by
following @ISA tree inheritance.

The loss in speed by validating all attributes is quite negligeable
on a decent machine (Pentium IV, 2.4 GHz) with Perl 5.8.x. But if you
want to avoid checking, you can do it.
