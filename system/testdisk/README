TestDisk is a powerful free data recovery software. It was primarily
designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting
disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty
software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as
accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery
using TestDisk is really easy.

PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files
including video, documents and archives from Hard Disks and CD-ROM and
lost pictures from digital camera memory.

To enable the use of sudo, run the script with SUDO=true, i.e.:
SUDO=true ./testdisk.SlackBuild

libewf is an optional dependency.
