# 20240314 bkw: update for v0.13.74.
# 20230604 bkw:
# - new maintainer.
# - update for v0.13.72.
# - switch to cmake.
# - make slack-desc more concise.

# Note: 0.13.71 had the file "usr/lib64/pkgconfig/zzip-zlib-config.pc",
# and 0.13.72 doesn't have it. Dependees are alephone and milkytracker [*].
# These build correctly without this .pc file. If anyone has issues
# with new builds because of this, please contact me.
# [*] desmume had zziplib listed in REQUIRES, but it doesn't actually
# use it (maybe it did at one time?).
