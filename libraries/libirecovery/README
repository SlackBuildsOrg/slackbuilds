libirecovery is a cross-platform library which implements communication
to iBoot/iBSS found on Apple's iOS devices via USB. A command-line uti-
lity named irecovery is also provided.

This is a fork of an older version from former openjailbreak.org and is
meant to be used with idevicerestore from the libimobiledevice project.
