easygui is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in
Python. Experienced Pythonistas need support for quick and dirty
GUI features. New Python programmers need GUI capabilities that
don't require any knowledge of Tkinter, frames, widgets, callbacks or
lambda. This is what easygui provides. Using it, all GUI interactions
are invoked by simple function calls.

easygui is different from other GUIs in that it is NOT event-driven.
It allows you to program in a traditional linear fashion, and to
put up dialogs for simple input and output when you need to do
so. If you have not yet learned the event-driven paradigm for GUI
programming, easygui will allow you to be productive with very basic
tasks immediately. If you later wish to make the transition to an
event-driven GUI paradigm, you can move to an event-driven style
with a more powerful GUI package such as anygui, PythonCard, Tkinter,
wxPython, etcetera.
