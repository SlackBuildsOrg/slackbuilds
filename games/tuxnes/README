TuxNES is an emulator for the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System.
It is based on Nestra, a great public-domain NES emulator by Quor.
TuxNES adds many features not found in Nestra, and uses a more
collaborative development model. Enhancements to Nestra often find
their way into TuxNES. Enhancements to TuxNES don't generally find
their way into Nestra due to licensing restrictions (since pieces
of TuxNES are generally copyrighted by their authors, and covered by
the GNU General Public License), although similar changes by the same
authors sometimes find their way back into Nestra.

TuxNES requires an x86-family processor.

If you would also like to install GTuxNES (a graphical launcher
for TuxNES), download its source tarball and place it in the same
directory as the SlackBuild. The GTuxNES homepage is:

The GTuxNES site appears to be down, but the source is mirrored here:
