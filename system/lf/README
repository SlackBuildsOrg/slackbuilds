lf (as in "list files") is a terminal file manager written in Go with
heavy inspiration from the ranger file manager.

Features:

* Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, BSDs, Windows)
* Single static binary with no runtime dependencies
* Fast startup and low memory footprint
* Asynchronous I/O operations to avoid UI blocking
* Server/client architecture with remote command support
* Extensible and configurable using shell commands
* Customizable keybindings (vi and readline defaults)
* A reasonable set of other features

Usage:

After installation, the lf command starts the application in the
current directory.

Run `lf -help` to see command-line options.
Run `lf -doc` to view the built-in documentation.
