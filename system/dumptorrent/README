DumpTorrent is a non-interactive, command-line utility that displays
detailed information about .torrent files. It extracts metadata such
as:

- Torrent name
- Total size
- File list
- Tracker announce URLs and announce-list
- Comment
- Creator information
- info_hash

It can also perform tracker scrape queries to retrieve the current
number of seeders, leechers, and completed downloads.
