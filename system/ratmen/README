ratmen generates a simple GUI menu based on a list of arguments. For
example, ratmen list ls tree "" will give you two choices, execute ls
or tree. (you don't need to specify the program name unless it differs
from the menu label) Ratmen can also print the choice to standard
output instead of executing it. It's a simple alternative to dmenu.

The name is derived from ratpoison, although it can be used in any WM.
