RtAudio is a set of C++ classes that provides a common API for
realtime audio input/output. RtAudio significantly simplifies the
process of interacting with computer audio hardware.

It was designed with the following objectives:
- object-oriented C++ design
- simple, common API across all supported platforms
- only one source and one header file for easy inclusion in
  programming projects
- allow simultaneous multi-api support
- support dynamic connection of devices
- provide extensive audio device parameter control
- allow audio device capability probing
- automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number
  compensation, (de)interleaving, and byte-swapping
