TaskJuggler is project management software for serious project managers.
It covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the
first idea to the completion of the project. It assists you during
project scoping, resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk
and communication management.

TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your project
time lines and resource assignments based on the project outline and the
constraints that you have provided. The built-in resource balancer and
consistency checker offload you from having to worry about irrelevant
details and ring the alarm if the project gets out of hand.

The flexible as-many-details-as-necessary approach allows you to
plan your project as you go, making it also ideal for new management
strategies such as Extreme Programming and Agile Project Management.
