Prints out colored unicode sprites of pokémon onto your terminal.
Contains almost 900 pokémon from gen 1 to gen 8. Has all the pokémons
you could ever want, including shinies and alternate forms (okay it's
still missing some female forms but cut me some slack).

The program requires python3 to run and a terminal with true color
support, which most modern terminals have.

You can run the program from the command line to either display a
pokémon of your choice by specifying the pokémon name or make it
display a random pokémon.

The program itself is a simple python script that prints out text
files corresponding to the relevant pokémon or a randomly selected
pokémon. The sprites are simple text files that use unicode characters
and ANSI color codes to display images of pokémon. The text sprite
files can be found in the colorscripts folder. The files were
generated using sprites taken from PokéSprite as the base and
converted to unicode sprites using custom scripts that can be found at
https://gitlab.com/phoneybadger/pokémon-generator-scripts

You can display a random pokémon whenever a terminal gets launched by
adding the "pokemon-colorscripts" -r command to your .bashrc or
.zshrc, or by chmoding the provided shell script to be executable:

  # chmod +x /etc/profile.d/pokemon-colorscripts-login.sh

You may also choose to disable Slackware's default fortune script by
disabling execution with chmod:

  # chmod -x /etc/profile.d/bsd-games-login-fortune.sh
