Yate is a next-generation telephony engine; while currently focused
on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and PSTN, its power lies in
its ability to be easily extended. Voice, video, data and instant
messenging can all be unified under Yate's flexible routing engine,
maximizing communications efficiency and minimizing infrastructure
costs for businesses.
