pygobject -- Python bindings for GObject. 

PyGObject is a Python package which provides bindings
for GObject based libraries such as GTK, GStreamer, 
WebKitGTK, GLib, GIO and many more.

PyGObject uses GLib, GObject, GIRepository, libffi 
and other libraries to access the C library 
(libgtk-4.so) in combination with the additional 
metadata from the accompanying typelib file 
(Gtk-4.0.typelib) and dynamically provides a Python 
interface based on that information.
