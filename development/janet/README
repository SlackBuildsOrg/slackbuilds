janet -- the janet programming language.

Janet is a programming language for system scripting, 
expressive automation, and extending programs written 
in C or C++ with user scripting capabilities.

Janet makes a good system scripting language, or a 
language to embed in other programs. It's like Lua 
and GNU Guile in that regard. It has more built-in 
functionality and a richer core language than Lua, but 
smaller than GNU Guile or Python. However, it is much 
easier to embed and port than Python or Guile.

There is a REPL for trying out the language, as well 
as the ability to run script files. This client program 
is separate from the core runtime, so Janet can be 
embedded in other programs. Try Janet in your browser
