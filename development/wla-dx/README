/6809/8008/8080/HUC6280/SPC-700 Multi Platform Cross Assembler Package

WLA DX is a set of tools to assemble assembly files to object or
library files (wla-ARCH) and linking them together (wlalink). WLA DX
isn't bound to one system (eg. NES or C64), but rather WLA DX allows
you to define your own memory map (that should be shared across all
object and library files).

GEN_DOC("ON" if "sphinx-build" is found, "OFF" otherwise, default is
OFF): building the documentation using development/Sphinx.
