gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call
(RPC) framework that can run anywhere. gRPC enables client and server
applications to communicate transparently, and simplifies the building
of connected systems.

This SlackBuild bundles python3-grpcio-tools (a protobuf code generator
for gRPC).

grpc (available at SlackBuilds.org) builds gRPC in C++ (rather than in
Python 3).
