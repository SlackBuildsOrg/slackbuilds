Postfix is Wietse Venema's mailer that started life as an alternative to
the widely-used Sendmail program. It attempts to be fast, easy to
administer, and secure, while at the same time, being sendmail
compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside has a
sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.

This script adds PostgreSQL support to postfix.
