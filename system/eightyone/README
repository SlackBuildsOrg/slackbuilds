EightyOne is an emulator for the range of ZX home computers made
by Sinclair Research (and their clones) in the 1980s, primarily
the ZX80 and ZX81 but also includes the ZX Spectrum models.
As well as emulating the machines themselves, various add-on
interfaces are supported, including storage devices, hi-res
graphics, custom character sets, sound and colour cards.

EightyOne was created by Michael D Wynne. Michael is no longer
actively developing the emulator, but has made the code open
source so that others can continue to extend it with new
functionality. This archive collates as many of the original
release versions of the emulator as possible, including the
source code for them where available. Versions up to 1.0a
were produced by Michael, with all later versions created
by others.
