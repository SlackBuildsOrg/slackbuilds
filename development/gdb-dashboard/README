GDB dashboard is a standalone .gdbinit file written using the Python API
that enables a modular interface showing relevant information about the
program being debugged. Its main goal is to reduce the number of GDB
commands needed to inspect the status of current program thus allowing
the developer to primarily focus on the control flow.

There are a few ways to enable the dashboard:

* Add the following line to the end of ~/.gdbinit:

  source /etc/gdbinit.d/dashboard

* Enable in the GDB command using the -x flag:

  gdb -q -x /etc/gdbinit.d/dashboard ...

or if using cgdb too:

  cgdb -- -q -x /etc/gdbinit.d/dashboard ...

You may find that using cgdb and dashboard together works best with a
vertical split.

  Press:

  <Esc>     to enter cgdb CLI.
  <Ctrl-W>  to toggle split orientation.
  i         to return to GDB insert mode.

Or add to ~/.cgdb/cdgbrc:

  set wso=vertical
