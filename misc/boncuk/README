Boncuk is a simple QT based Turkish-English and English-Turkish
dictionary which can do off-line and on-line look-ups. By
default, it will install the off-line word look-up database in
/usr/share/boncuk/. If you don't want to use the off-line word
database (to instead use only the on-line word look-up), run the
script like this:

   DICT_INSTALL=NO ./boncuk.SlackBuild.
