# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-PPIx-QuoteLike: This Perl class parses Perl string literals and things that are

perl-PPIx-QuoteLike: interpolated variables for Perl::Critic policies and similar code.
perl-PPIx-QuoteLike:
perl-PPIx-QuoteLike: The parse is fairly straightforward, and a little poking around with
perl-PPIx-QuoteLike: eg/pqldump should show how it normally goes.
