Warpinator is an open-source file-sharing application designed to
facilitate the transfer of files over local networks.
It was developed by the team behind the Linux distribution Linux Mint
and is particularly known for its ease of use, making it accessible
for users who may not be technically inclined.

The application allows users to send files between devices running
different operating systems, including Linux, Windows, Android and
macOS.

By default, Warpinator runs without incoming file isolation. It is
recommended to enable this by setting the CONFIG_SECURITY_LANDLOCK
module in the kernel.

Theoretically, Warpinator can also be sandboxed using bubblewrap, but
the maintainer has encountered a DBus connection problem. We encourage
users who have successfully sandboxed Warpinator with bubblewrap to
share their solutions.
