uliGo is a program to practice solving go problems.
It comes with a few problems, and you can use it with classical
go problems, or with problems of your own.

In order to help you to learn to handle shapes instead of certain
problems uliGo randomly rotates and mirrors the board, and switches
black and white. You can also use uliGo to replay (pro) games, and
guess the next move.
