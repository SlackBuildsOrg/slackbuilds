# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rejoystick:
rejoystick: Rejoystick is a program that maps movement and button presses on
rejoystick: your gamepad/joypad/joystick to keypresses on a keyboard when you
rejoystick: are running X. Since it uses SDL to communicate with the gamepad
rejoystick: device, it can work on every platform that provides SDL and an X
rejoystick: environment. (Though it is yet to be tested on Cygwin e.g.)
