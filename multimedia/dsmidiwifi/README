An application that runs on the computer and forwards the MIDI
messages received via Wifi to MIDI applications.

Mini howto: Start jack and dsmidiwifi. Then start a (dsmi) wifimidi
program on another network device (like midimonitor on iPad)

Optional runtime dependencies (for easy routing of dsmidiwifi) are
jack and qjackctl
