ContourPy is a Python library for calculating contours of 2D
quadrilateral grids.  It is written in C++11 and wrapped using pybind11.

It contains the 2005 and 2014 algorithms used in Matplotlib as well as
a newer algorithm that includes more features and is available in both
serial and multithreaded versions.

NOTE: This is intended to be installed mainly as a dependency for newer
      matplotlib versions. Thus, presently just the core functionality
      is provided, since additional features, i.e. the bokeh renderer,
      need optional dependencies, which are not yet available through
      SlackBuilds.org. This might change in the future.
