TStools (Command line tools for working with MPEG data)

TStools are relatively simple tools which concentrate on MPEG (H.264
and H.262) data packaged according to H.222 (i.e., TS or PS), with a
particular interest in checking for conformance.

Transport Stream (TS) is typically used for distribution of cable and
satellite data. Program Stream (PS) is typically used to store data
on DVDs.

The tools are focussed on:

* Quick reporting of useful data (tsinfo, stream_type)
* Giving a quick overview of the entities in the stream (esdots,
  psdots)
* Reporting on TS packets (tsreport) or ES units/frames/fields
  (esreport)
* Simple manipulation of stream data (es2ts, esfilter, esreverse,
  esmerge, ts2es)
* Streaming of data, possibly with introduced errors (tsplay)
