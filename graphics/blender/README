Blender is the free open source 3D content creation suite, available
for all major operating systems under the GNU General Public License.

NOTE: This is a repackaging of upstream's binary bundle. They only
provide 64bit bundles, so 32bit is unsupported without compiling it
yourself, which is available on SBo under:

  'graphics/Blender' (note the big "B")
