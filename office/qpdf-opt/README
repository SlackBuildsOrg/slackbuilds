QPDF is a program and C++ library for structural, content-preserving
transformations on PDF files.

This script installs qpdf to /opt and can be installed alongside the
stock qpdf. Its purpose is to provide an updated version of qpdf.

The executables are added to the PATH by placing the files qpdf-opt.sh
and qpdf-opt.csh in /etc/profile.d.
