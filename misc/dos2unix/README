This is an update of Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and
unix2dos.  Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos are
part of several Linux distributions such as RedHat, Fedora, Suse, Gentoo
and some others. On Slackware one finds fromdos and todos but these
implementations are not included. This update includes all RedHat
patches and fixes several other problems.

These implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos have been modeled after
dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris. They have similar conversion
modes, namely ASCII, 7bit and ISO. The first versions were made by John
Birchfield in 1989, and in 1995 rewritten from scratch by Benjamin Lin.
Mac to Unix conversion was added by Bernd Johannes Wuebben in 1998, Unix
to Mac by Erwin in 2010.
