convmv (convert filenames to utf8 or any other charset)

convmv converts filenames (not file content), directories, and even
whole filesystems to a different encoding. Though it's primarily
written to convert from/to UTF-8, it can also be used with almost any
other charset encoding. Convmv can also be used for case conversion
from upper to lower case and vice versa with virtually any charset.
