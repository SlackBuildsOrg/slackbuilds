# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-ifaddr: python3-ifaddr (Python Library to enumerate all network interfaces)
python3-ifaddr:
python3-ifaddr: ifaddr is a small Python library that allows you to find all the
python3-ifaddr: Ethernet and IP addresses of the computer. It is tested on Linux,
python3-ifaddr: OS X, and Windows. Other BSD derivatives like OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
python3-ifaddr: and NetBSD should work too, but I haven't personally tested
python3-ifaddr: those. Solaris/Illumos should also work.
