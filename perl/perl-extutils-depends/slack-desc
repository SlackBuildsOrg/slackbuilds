# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-extutils-depends: perl-extutils-depends (perl module)
perl-extutils-depends:
perl-extutils-depends: This  module  tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
perl-extutils-depends: functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions.  This means
perl-extutils-depends: that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that  provides
perl-extutils-depends: a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.
