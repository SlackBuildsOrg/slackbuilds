rear (bare metal disaster recovery and system migration tool)

Relax-and-Recover is the leading Open Source bare metal disaster
recovery and system migration solution. It is a modular framework with
many ready-to-go workflows for common situations.

Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can
repartition the system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from
backup. Restores to different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover
can therefore be used as a migration tool as well.
