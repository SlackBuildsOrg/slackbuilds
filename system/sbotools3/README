sbotools3 (ports-like interface to slackbuilds.org)

sbotools3 is the continuation of sbotools. It is a set of Perl scripts
providing a ports-like automation interface to slackbuilds.org. Features
include dependency handling, using a custom git branch, generating
32-bit and compat32 builds on multilib systems, and more.

There is a man page for each included command. For 'executive
summaries' and online man pages, see the project's home page.

sbotools3 bundles the required Perl module Sort::Versions. This does
not interfere with a copy installed from the CPAN or from
slackbuilds.org.

sbotools3 installs a default configuration file to
/etc/sbotools/sbotools.conf.new. Existing sbotools.conf files from
sbotools are compatible, but sbotools users may want to examine
the new file for added options and annotation.

sbotools3 conflicts with sbotools. Uninstalling sbotools before
installing sbotools3 is recommended.
