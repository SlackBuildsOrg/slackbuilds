fetcha is a small system information tool written in C.

It follows a suckless-style design and prints basic system information
(OS, kernel, memory, CPU, etc.) alongside a small ASCII logo.

fetcha is intended for lightweight window managers, terminal usage,
and SSH sessions.

Like other suckless-style tools, fetcha uses a C-based configuration.
The file config.def.h contains the default settings, and config.h is
used as the active configuration at build time.

If you want fetcha to run automatically when starting a shell, add the
line "fetcha" to the end of your shell configuration file (for example
~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc).

This SlackBuild applies a small patch to change the default ASCII logo
to a neutral one suitable for Slackware.
