progman (a simple window manager)

progman is a simple window manager designed to handle the layout
of windows with a focus on simplicity. It is lightweight, fast,
and easy to configure, making it ideal for users who prefer
minimalism.

Some of the features include tiling window management,
customizable keybindings, support for multiple monitors, and
a small codebase that is easy to modify and extend.

A sample configuration file is installed as:

  /usr/doc/progman-1.0/progman.ini

The configuration file is optional. To use it, copy it to:

  ~/.config/progman/progman.ini

Example:

  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/progman
  $ cp /usr/doc/progman-1.0/progman.ini \
      ~/.config/progman/progman.ini
