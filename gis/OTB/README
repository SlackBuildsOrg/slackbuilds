ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is an open source library of image processing
algorithms.
OTB is based on the medical image processing library ITK and offers
particular functionalities for remote sensing image processing in
general and for high spatial resolution images in particular. Targeted
algorithms for high resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT,
QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors
(Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are available.

All of OTB's algorithms are accessible from other platforms like
QGIS, Python, command line, C++, and Monteverdi. Monteverdi is a
satellite image viewer with access to OTB processing. Until version
8.1.2, Monteverdi could be included in a single build, but since 9.0.0
version the image viewer is available only a standalone application.
If you are interested to the integrated graphic interface, you must
refer to OTB-legacy package (available in this repository) otherwise
you have to build and install separately the package Monteverdi.

OTB will be built with support for the following packages if they are
available at compile time: numpy3.

Warnings
1. The build fails if Shark is not built against the optional
   dependency cblas that gives the support to ATLAS.
2. OTB sources in lastest version has changed in several areas and the
   build could require - at least in some Linux distributions - the
   launch of post-install scripts to patch the default settings and
   adapt them to the system environment. This could not be needed in
   Slackware, but the upgrade is not sufficiently tested in runtime, so
   please report any issues to the maintainer.
   You might also consider the installation of the legacy version that
   is provided by the slackbuild OTB-legacy (v. 8.1.2) that replaces
   the old OTB package.
