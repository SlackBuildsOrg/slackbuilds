gmi100 (Gemini CLI protocol client written in 100 lines of ANSI C)

I tried to pack as much as possible in 100 lines of ANSI C. Initially
I struggled to fit simple TLS connection in such small space but
eventually I ended up with CLI client capable of efficient navigation
between capsules of Gemini space.
