PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into
stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and
AIX. Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works
with any version of Python since 2.4, it builds smaller executables
thanks to transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and
use the OS support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full
compatibility.
