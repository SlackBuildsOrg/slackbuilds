WolfMAME is a fork of MAME which facilitates the recording of speedruns and other achievements in arcade games.

Users recorded .inp files will be placed in /opt/wolfmame/inp

To speed up compilation, you may use "export MAKEFLAGS=-j4" before
building, where 4 is the number of cores on your system.

Note that ccache is off by default. To turn on ccache use:

  USE_CCACHE=yes ./wolfmame.SlackBuild
