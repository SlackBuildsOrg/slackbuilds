ieee-pilot (implementation of the PILOT programming language)

Reference implementation of IEEE Pilot, a CAI language. This is an
implementation of the very old (1962) CAI language Pilot, as described
by IEEE Std 1154-1991, ISBN 1-55937-151-X.

ieee-pilot can run as an interpreter or compile Pilot programs to
standalone executables. It supports some extensions to the language,
taken from the Atari, Apple, and Nevada implementations. Also, an
ieee-pilotconv utility is included, which converts Capitol Pilot
programs to standard IEEE Pilot.

To avoid conflicting with Slackware's alpine package (which has a
/usr/bin/pilot command), the executables and man pages are installed
as ieee-pilot and ieee-pilotconv.
