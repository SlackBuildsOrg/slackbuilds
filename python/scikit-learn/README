scikit-learn is an open source Python library that implements a range
of machine learning, preprocessing, cross-validation and visualization
algorithms using a unified interface.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 1.4.0 due to requiring a
newer Cython than included in Slackware (needs 3.0.8).
