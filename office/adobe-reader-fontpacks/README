Asian and Extended Language Font Packs for Adobe Reader

There are several additional Font Packs available for Adobe Reader
so you can display and interact with documents authored in languages
other than those supported in your native Adobe Reader. They fall in
to 2 different categories.

Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese and Korean Font
Packs: They are needed to correctly display a document when an author
does not embed the appropriate font in to the document. They are
also needed when the author does embed the font, but the reader
of the document wishes to interact in some way with its content
? e.g. collaborating, commenting or filling out forms.

Extended Language Font Pack: This Font Pack covers Hebrew, Arabic,
Thai, Vietnamese as well as the Eastern and Central European languages
(including Cyrillic and Greek scripts).  Documents in these languages
always have their fonts embedded. Therefore, similar to the previous
case, this Font Pack is needed only if the reader of the document
wishes to interact in some way with its content - e.g.  collaborating,
commenting or filling out forms.

The Slackbuild can be built with only one of the fontpacks but will
include all of them if they are available in the directory.

adobe-reader is not "required" to build this package but the package
will be completely useless without it. :-)
