Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored
on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in
each replica to the other.

Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with
updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates
that do not conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates
are detected and displayed.

Unison allows you to either build a text-only binary or a binary that
will use a graphical user interface.

By default this slackbuild will, similar to Slackware's own emacs
package, build both a text-only and a gui binary. To do this (which is
the default):

  "FLAVOUR='gtk2 text' ./unison.SlackBuild"

...or just "./unison.SlackBuild"

To only build a text only binary, do this:

  "FLAVOUR=text ./unison.SlackBuild"

To only build a gui only binary, do this:

  "FLAVOUR=gtk2 ./unison.SlackBuild"

hevea is an optional dependency which allows building the HTML
documentation. Otherwise only PDF docs will be built.
