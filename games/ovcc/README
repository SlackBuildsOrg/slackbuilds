ovcc (CoCo 3 emulator)

ovcc is the portable and Open Virtual Color Computer, a cross-platform
port of the Windows-only VCC emulator.

ovcc is an accurate emulation of a "stock" Tandy Color Computer 3 (aka
CoCo 3), just as you would have bought in a Radio Shack store or Tandy
Computer Center in 1986-1992.

The package includes the ROM images needed for all the emulated
hardware.
