PeaZip free file archiver utility.
PeaZip is an Open Source (LGPLv3) cross-platform archive manager 
utility, supporting over 200 archiving and compression formats as 7Z, 
BZip2, Brotli, GZip, PEA, RAR, ZIP, ZPAQ, Zstandard, and many more.

There are three widget sets you can use:
gtk2: default option
gtk3: alpha stage, not tested
qt6:  require lazarus qt6 bindings, not tested

If, for example, you want to use gtk3, run:
WIDGET=gtk3 ./PeaZip.SlackBuild

lazarus is required only for build, not for runtime.
arc, unace and upx are optional runtime dependencies.
