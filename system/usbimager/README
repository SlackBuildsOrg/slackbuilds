USBImager is a really really simple GUI application that writes
compressed disk images to USB drives and creates backups. Its interface
is as simple as it gets, totally bloat-free. USBImager's main audience
is the non-expert average user, who is (sadly) afraid of the command
line.

Features:

- Open Source and MIT licensed
- Portable executable
- Small. Really small, few kilobytes only, yet has no dependencies
- No privacy concerns nor advertisements like with etch*r, fully GDPR
  compatible
- Minimalist, multilingual, native interface on all platforms
- Tries to be bullet-proof and avoids overwriting of the system disk
- Makes synchronized writes, that is, all data is on disk when the
  progressbar reaches 100%
- Can verify writing by comparing the disk to the image
- Can read raw disk images: .img, .bin, .raw, .iso, .dd, etc.
- Can read compressed images on-the-fly: .gz, .bz2, .xz, .zst
- Can read archives on-the-fly: .zip (PKZIP and ZIP64), .zzz (ZZZip),
  .tar, .cpio, .pax (*)
- Can create backups in raw and ZStandard compressed format
- Can send images to microcontrollers over serial line
- Available in 18 languages

By default, GTK3 version is built which relies on Udisks2 to get access
to USB drives. To build an X11 version which uses an SGID bit for group
disk instead:

    USE_X11=yes ./usbimager.SlackBuild

If an X11 version can't render text in your language, you need to
install gnu-unifont (or any other Unicode-capable font), or,
alternatively, embed Unifont into the binary:

    USE_UNIFONT=yes ./usbimager.SlackBuild
