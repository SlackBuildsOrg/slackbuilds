twind is a simple daemon serving static files over the gemini protocol.

It is intended to have as few knobs as possible and has no support for
a configuration file.

twind is named after the latin word for gemini - twins.

Features:
 * Serving static gemini files
 * Virtual hosts
 * MIME handling
 * IPv4 and IPv6 support

It doesn't support CGI handling and probably never will. There are more
advanced gemini servers out there if you look for fancy stuff.

---

twind needs a dedicated user called '_twind' and directory to run.
User is created with SlackBuild script automatically: 'make user'

For undo this action (ex. case you uninstalled twind):

# userdel -r _twind

By default, the user ID for _twind is set to 4000. You can change this
if wish declaring variable 'TWIND_ID' for what you need:

TWIND_ID=3377 ./twind.SlackBuild

twind will create TLS certificates auto-signed too, by default hostname
for certificate is 'example.com' that can be changed declaring
'TWIND_HN' variable:

TWIND_HN=slackware.com ./twind.SlackBuild

Can you do use of both in same time:

TWIND_ID=3377 TWIND_HN=slackware.com ./twind.SlackBuild

SECURITY CONCERN
 twind needs root permissions to start and will drop its privileges as
 soon as possible. It will also chroot to /var/twind

How to use: README.md on doc folder has the informations or see Github.

NOTE of maintainer: Makefile was adapted because the original is poor
All respect for author of twind, that is a good and simple Gemini Server

Enjoy :-)
