Ximaging is a lightweight, multithreaded, open source image viewer
for several platforms running X11. It can be run in viewer or browser
mode, displays full size images and provides zooming, panning,
rotation and other useful functions.

As of a recent version, XImaging supports the use of external filters
to support more image formats, as defined by X resources. This script
may add support for the following formats by setting FILTERS=yes in
the build script: JPEG-XL, JPEG-2000 and WEBP. This will require the
presence of libjxl from SBo for decoding of JPEG-XL files, otherwise
loading of those files will fail..
