# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-lap: python3-lap (Linear Assignment Problem solver LAPJV/LAPMOD)
python3-lap:
python3-lap: lap is a linear assignment problem solver using Jonker-Volgenant
python3-lap: algorithm for dense LAPJV or sparse LAPMOD matrices. Both algorithms
python3-lap: are implemented from scratch based solely on the papers and the
python3-lap: public domain Pascal implementation provided by A. Volgenant. The
python3-lap: LAPMOD implementation seems to be faster than the LAPJV implementation
python3-lap: for matrices with a side of more than ~5000 and with less than 50%
python3-lap: finite coefficients.
