OpenConnect is a client for Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN, which is
supported by the ASA5500 Series, by IOS 12.4(9)T or later on Cisco
SR500, 870, 880, 1800, 2800, 3800, 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 Routers,
and probably others.

Like vpnc, OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or associated in 
any way with, Cisco Systems. It just happens to interoperate with their 
equipment.
