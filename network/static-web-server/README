static-web-server
=================

Static Web Server is a lightweight and fast web server written in Rust.
It serves static files with minimal setup.

Features:
 - Directory listings
 - MIME type detection
 - HTTP compression
 - Range requests
 - ETag caching
 - TLS support with rustls

This package installs:
 - /usr/bin/static-web-server
 - /etc/rc.d/rc.sws.new (init script example)

Usage:
  # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.sws
  # rc.sws start

By default, rc.sws uses port 8080 and root=/srv/http.
You must edit rc.sws to set the desired --root folder
for your files, such as /home/mirror or /var/www.

Slackware installs rc scripts disabled by default.
Enable it with chmod +x before starting.

If you want static-web-server to start at boot, add:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sws ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.sws start
  fi
to /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
