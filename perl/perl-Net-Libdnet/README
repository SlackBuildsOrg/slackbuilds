Net::Libdnet - binding for Dug Song's libdnet

Net::Libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several
low-level networking routines, including network address manipulation,
kernel arp cache and route table lookup and manipulation, network
firewalling, network interface lookup and manipulation, network
traffic interception via tunnel interfaces, and raw IP packet
and Ethernet frame transmission. It is intended to complement the
functionality provided by libpcap.
