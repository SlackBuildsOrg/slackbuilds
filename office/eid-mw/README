This package contains software and viewer for the Belgian electronic
identity card. With this, you can:

- Communicate with secure websites that require eID authentication
- Sign documents and emails using your eID
- Using the viewer, read the identity data on eID cards, verify their
  validity, and store them for future usage
- Using the provided API, do all of the above in custom applications
  of your own.

So as to use your card reader on Firefox, you will have to enable
the Mozilla add-on:

pcsc-tools is an optional dependency if you want to mess with your
smart card reader, or to test a PC/SC driver.
