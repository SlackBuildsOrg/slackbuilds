# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

supercat:
supercat: Supercat prints text files in a colorized manner based on regular
supercat: expression rules. By default it suports a handful of known filetypes,
supercat: such as C and Python source, ChangeLogs, diffs, etc. The real beauty
supercat: of this simple program though is that you can easily write your own
supercat: highlighting files with a little regex know-how.
