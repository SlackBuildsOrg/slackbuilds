julius-game (open source re-implementation of Caesar III)

Julius is a fully working open-source version of Caesar 3, with the
same logic as the original, but with some UI enhancements, that can
be played on multiple platforms.

Julius will not run without the original Caesar 3 files. You can buy
a digital copy from GOG or Steam, or you can use an original CD-ROM
version.

The goal of the project is to have exactly the same game logic as
Caesar 3, with the same look and feel. This means that the saved
games are 100% compatible with Caesar 3, and any gameplay bugs
present in the original Caesar 3 game will also be present in Julius.
