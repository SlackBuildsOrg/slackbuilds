bkt (count repeats in input)

bkt reads input from files or standard input, splits it into records,
optionally transforms them according to various options, and counts
like records. After all input is read, a count and percentage is
given for the occurrence of each record. The name 'bkt' comes from the
concept of collecting like items in buckets.
