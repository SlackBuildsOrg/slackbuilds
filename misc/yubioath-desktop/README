Store your unique credential on a hardware-backed security key and take
it wherever you go from mobile to desktop. No more storing sensitive
secrets on your mobile phone, leaving your account vulnerable
to takeovers. With the Yubico Authenticator you can raise the bar
for security.

The Yubico Authenticator will work with any USB or NFC-enabled
YubiKeys.

The Yubico Authenticator securely generates a code used to verify your
identity as you are logging into various services. No connectivity
needed!

This SlackBuild repackages the pre-built binary by Yubico. No 32bit
version is provided.

There is a bug that appears in certain configurations which makes some
of the authenticator dialogs flicker making them unusable. In such
a case shrink the window's width until all menus and icons hide under
"hamburger" buttons and access them from there.
