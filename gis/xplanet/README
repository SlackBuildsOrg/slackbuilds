Xplanet renders planetary and solar system images. It can be used to
create computer wallpapers or single images. Xplanet can show city
names, overlay cloud maps or display which regions of Earth are day or
night.  Xplanet can be used to produce projected maps based on several
projections, such as mollweide, which show the whole earth at once, or
mercator, which is rectangular and is suitable for filling the screen.

See /usr/share/xplanet for maps, config files, scripts, and so on.
