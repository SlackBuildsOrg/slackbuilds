ethersrv-linux (server for EtherDFS)

EtherDFS is an 'installable filesystem' TSR for MS-DOS. It maps a
drive from a remote computer (typically Linux-based) to a local drive
letter, using raw ethernet frames to communicate.

ethersrv-linux is an implementation of EtherSRV for Linux. It allows
a Linux computer to share its drive over Ethernet with multiple MS-DOS
clients running EtherDFS.

ethersrv-linux must run as root. There is no /etc/rc.d script in the
package, but you can start it from /etc/rc.d/rc.local with a command
like:

  /usr/sbin/ethersrv-linux eth0 /path/to/dos/files &> /dev/null &

There is no EtherDFS client for Linux. The MS-DOS client is included
in the package as /usr/share/ethersrv-linux/client/etherdfs.exe, and
the client's docs are in /usr/doc/ethersrv-linux-$VERSION/client/.
