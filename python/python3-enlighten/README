python-enlighten (Progress bar for Python console apps)

Enlighten Progress Bar is a console progress bar library for Python.

The main advantage of Enlighten is it allows writing to stdout and 
stderr without any redirection or additional code. Just print or log as 
you normally would.

Enlighten also includes experimental support for Jupyter Notebooks.
