Send2Trash is a small package that sends files to the Trash (or
Recycle Bin) natively and on all platforms. On OS X, it uses native
FSMoveObjectToTrashSync Cocoa calls, on Windows, it uses native
(and ugly) SHFileOperation win32 calls. On other platforms, if
PyGObject and GIO are available, it will use this.  Otherwise, it will
fallback to its own implementation of the trash specifications from
freedesktop.org.
