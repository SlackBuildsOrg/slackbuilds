Perltidy reads a perl script and writes an indented, reformatted
script. The formatting process involves converting the script into a
string of tokens, removing any non-essential whitespace, and then
rewriting the string of tokens with whitespace using whatever rules
are specified, or defaults. This happens in a series of operations
which can be controlled with parameters.
