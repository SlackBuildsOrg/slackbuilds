sbbdep (Slack Build Binary Dependencies)
The tool for exploring binary runtime dependencies
on Slackware and Slackware based systems.

sbbdep uses sqlite3 for storing information. Per default, sbbdep
builds with an own version of sqlite and links statically against
it. This can be changed.

If this is done, sbbdep will need the sqlite3 package, which comes per
default with Slackware, and will link against the shared sqlite3.so
library from the system.

If you want to activate this, pass the following option to the
Slackbuild: USE_INTERNAL_SQLITE3=0
