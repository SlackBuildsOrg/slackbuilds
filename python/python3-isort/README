isort is a Python utility/library to sort imports alphabetically, and
automatically separated into sections. It provides a command line
utility, Python library and plugins for various editors to quickly sort
all your imports.

This Python 3 version of the isort package doesn't contain the command
line utility. Install Python 2 isort package to get the utility.
