mtm (Micro Terminal Multiplexer)

mtm is a very small, curses-based terminal multiplexer that allows
splitting a single terminal screen into multiple panes.

Unlike tmux or screen, mtm does not support sessions, windows, mouse
interaction, or runtime configuration. All panes are always visible,
and control is entirely keyboard-driven. This makes mtm simple,
predictable, and lightweight.

This SlackBuild packages mtm version 1.2.1 (last upstream release).
It includes a small backported upstream patch adding a "nuke" key
binding, which clears the current pane's screen and scrollback
buffer (Ctrl-g k by default). No other behavior is changed.

mtm is suitable for users who want basic pane splitting without the
complexity of a full terminal workspace manager.

  Ctrl-g v   split vertically
  Ctrl-g h   split horizontally
