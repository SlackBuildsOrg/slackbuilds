binfmt-support

The binfmt_misc kernel module, contained in versions 2.1.43 and
later of the Linux kernel, allows system administrators to register
interpreters for various binary formats based on a magic number or
their file extension, and cause the appropriate interpreter to be
invoked whenever a matching file is executed. Think of it as a more
flexible version of the #! executable interpreter mechanism.

binfmt-support provides an update-binfmts script with which package
maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module
without having to worry about writing their own init.d scripts, and
which sysadmins can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this
module.

You will want to add an fstab entry for binfmt_misc:

    none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0

You will also want to make sure the binfmt_misc kernel module
is loaded at boot by adding '/sbin/modprobe binfmt_misc' to
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local.

To have binfmt-support start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support start
  fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support stop
  fi
