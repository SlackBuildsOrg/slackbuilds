proj is a generic coordinate transformation software, that transforms
coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to another. This
includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations.

For datum grids, install the proj-data package. Without this package,
proj can fetch required grids from the internet as needed.

By default, the script does not build nor run the tests. You can use the
option TESTBUILD=YES to build and run the tests before the make install
part.
