gzdoom (OpenGL port of DOOM)

Enhanced OpenGL port of the official DOOM source code that also supports
Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.

This is the latest version of gzdoom, which may not run well on
older/slower systems, and doesn't support 32-bit x86 at all. If
you have problems, try running with "-glversion 3.3". If it still
won't start, or doesn't run smoothly on your system, try installing
gzdoom-legacy instead. Note that gzdoom and gzdoom-legacy conflict:
only install one or the other.

See README_SBo.txt for optional runtime dependencies.
