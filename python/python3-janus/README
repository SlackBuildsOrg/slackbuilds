Mixed sync-async queue, supposed to be used for communicating between
classic synchronous (threaded) code and asynchronous (in terms of
asyncio) one.

Like Janus god the queue object from the library has two faces:
synchronous and asynchronous interface.

Synchronous is fully compatible with standard queue, asynchronous one
follows asyncio queue design.
