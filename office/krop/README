krop is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files.

It is written in Python and relies on python-poppler-qt5 or PyMuPDF for
rendering, and pypdf/PyPDF2 or pikepdf or PyMuPDF for cropping. It
features automatic margin cropping.

Krop can automatically split pages into subpages to fit the limited
screen size of devices such as eReaders. This is particularly useful, if
your eReader does not support convenient scrolling.

This script has no build dependencies.

Two runtime dependencies to be choosen from the following options:
* python-poppler-qt5 or PyMuPDF
* pypdf (version > 3) or PyPDF2 or pikepdf or PyMuPDF
They are autodetected or set manually using options.
