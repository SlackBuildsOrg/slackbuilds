skim is a fuzzy finder that can be used as a general filter like grep
or as an interactive interface for invoking commands.

Vim Users: A skim.vim plugin is installed to
/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/plugin. If you'd rather exclude the plugin,
or only manually enable it in your vim, you can build with:

WITH_VIM=no ./skim.SlackBuild

and the plugin will be installed to /usr/share/skim/vim/ instead.
