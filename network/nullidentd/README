nullidentd (bare minimum identd server)

nullidentd is intended to be a bare minimum identd server. It
implements the auth protocol from RFC 1413. This protocol
is used to identify active TCP connections. It depends on the
trustworthiness of the server and as such is completely useless as
a method of identification.

Unfortunately, some applications still require that an identd
server is available to query about incoming connections. nullidentd
implements the absolute minimum server to allow these applications to
function. It returns a fake response for any request.

nullidentd is typically invoked from inetd. The following is a typical
/etc/inetd.conf example:

auth stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/nullidentd nullidentd
