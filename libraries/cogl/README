Cogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware for
rendering. The API departs from the flat state machine style of OpenGL
and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that
can render without stepping on each others toes.

Having other backends, besides OpenGL, such as drm, Gallium or D3D are
options we are interested in for the future.

Below variables can be used to configure the build:
  GTKDOC=yes        : Use gtk-doc to build documentation
  INTROSPECTION=yes : Enable introspection for this build
