yt-dlp-bin (download videos from youtube and other video sites)

yt-dlp is a feature-rich command-line audio/video downloader with
support for thousands of sites. The project is a fork of youtube-dl,
based on the now-inactive youtube-dlc.

This is a repackaging of the official yt-dlp_linux binary from the
yt-dlp developers. Only x86_64 and aarch64 are supported. There is no
32-bit x86 support.

The file "yt-dlp-bin.info.aarch64" has the download URL for aarch64.
You can use this as a custom .info file in sbopkg, or just wget the
URL.

This build conflicts with yt-dlp: only install one or the other of
yt-dlp and yt-dlp-bin.

The reason this build even exists is that, at some point, yt-dlp will
drop support for python-3.9 and will stop working on Slackware 15.0.
The binary release includes its own python interpreter, so it will be
the only way to run yt-dlp on Slack 15.0. By the time you read this,
it may have aleady happened: python-3.9 will be officially EOLed in
October 2025.
