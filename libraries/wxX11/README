wxWidgets lets developers create applications for Win32, Mac OS X,
GTK+, X11, Motif, WinCE, and more using one codebase. It can be
used from languages such as C++, Python, Perl, and C#/.NET. Unlike
other cross- platform toolkits, wxWidgets applications look and feel
native. This is because wxWidgets uses the platform's own native
controls rather than emulating them.

This package is built with the '--disable-gui' flag, which requires
GTK1 or GTK2. If you need it for that purpose, then you need to track
down those gtk dependencies.

Note to maintainers: do not list wxX11 as a dependency for your
builds! List either wxPython (for software requiring wx-2.x) or wxGTK3
(for software requiring wx-3.x).
