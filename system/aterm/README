aterm (old-school terminal emulator with nice visual effects)

aterm is designed to provide pleasing visual effects while performing
such a mundane function as terminal emulation under X. It is largely
based on rxvt code.

Note: aterm hasn't been maintained by its developers in decades. This
build is provided for completeness' sake (for someone trying to
recreate the late 90s AfterStep experience) but you'd be better off
using something like Slackware's rxvt-unicode, or even xterm.
