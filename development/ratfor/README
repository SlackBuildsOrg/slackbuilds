ratfor (ratfor preprocessor for fortran77)

Ratfor is short for Rational Fortran. If you are not familiar with
Ratfor, SEP has a good page about it here:

  https://sepwww.stanford.edu/sep/prof/pvi/rat/paper_html/node1.html

...and Brian W. Kernighan's paper on the language can be found here:

  http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/repro/ratfor.pdf

Ratfor was used in the classic Software Tools text by Kernighan and
Plauger, published by Addison and Wesley. Ratfor translates Rational
Fortran to Fortran-77, which can then be compiled with a F77 compiler
such as GNU Fortran.

This Linux Ratfor is derived from the public domain ratfor
version 1.0 by Oz, Ken Yap, W. Bauske (IBM), and SEP
(http://sepwww.stanford.edu). It is still in the public domain.

To compile and run a ratfor program:

  ratfor -o prog.f prog.r
  f77 -o prog prog.f
  ./prog

There are some sample/test programs in "/usr/doc/ratfor-$VERSION/tests".
