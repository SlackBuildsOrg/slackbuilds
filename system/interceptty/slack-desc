# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

interceptty: interceptty (serial, terminal, socket, file descriptor sniffer)
interceptty:
interceptty: interceptty is designed to sit between a serial port (or other
interceptty: terminal device, or program, or socket, or something connected to a
interceptty: file descriptor) and a program which is communicating with that
interceptty: device, recording everything that goes back and forth between the two.
interceptty: It does this by opening the real device, creating a pseudo-tty, then
interceptty: forwarding everything between the two, recording whatever it sees.
interceptty: It has a number of options that let you fine-tune the devices it
interceptty: uses and the terminal options for the real device.
