FreeImage - image library

FreeImage is an Open Source library project for developers
who would like to support popular graphics image formats like
PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF and others as needed by today's multimedia
applications. FreeImage is easy to use, fast, and multithreading safe.
This script compiles the FreeImage library and the FreeImagePlus C++
wrapper.
