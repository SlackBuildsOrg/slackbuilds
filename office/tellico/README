Tellico is a KDE application for keeping track of your collections.
It provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos,
music, coins, stamps, trading cards, comic books, and wines.
Ultimately, the goal is for it to be similar in capability to
AVCataloger or Readerware, although it's still got a ways to go.

Tellico allows you to enter your collection in a catalogue
database, saving many different properties like title, author, etc.
Two different views of your collection are shown.  On the left, your
entries are grouped together by any field you like, allowing you to
see how many are in each group.  On the right, selected fields are
shown in column format, allowing you to sort by any field.  On the
bottom is a customizable HTML view of the current entry.  The entry
editor is a dialog box where you enter the data.  You can even read
barcodes with a webcam.

yaz and exempi are optional (but recommended) dependencies.
