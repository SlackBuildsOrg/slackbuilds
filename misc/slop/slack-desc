# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

slop: slop (select operation)
slop:
slop: slop is an application that queries for a selection from the user and
slop: prints the region to stdout. It grabs the mouse and turns it into a
slop: crosshair, lets the user click and drag to make a selection (or click
slop: on a window) while drawing a pretty box around it, then finally prints
slop: the selection's dimensions to stdout.
