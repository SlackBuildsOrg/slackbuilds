This directory is a local OVERLAY of desktop/pekwm.

It is used for local customization and testing.
On Slackware-current, xinitrc.pekwm is modified to start PipeWire
services to ensure audio works correctly without relying on a
system-wide session manager.

Changes in this directory are local-only and not intended for
upstream submission.
