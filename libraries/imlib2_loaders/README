imlib2_loaders (xcf image loader for imlib2)

This package contains image loader plugins for Imlib 2 that are not
distributed together with the Imlib 2 package itself, for licensing
reasons. Currently, the only plugin is for XCF, which is the Gimp's
native file format.

Note: the version number of this does not have to match the version
number of imlib2. The actual C code for imlib2_loaders hasn't changed
since 2022; upstream releases a "new" version of imlib2_loaders
whenever there's a new imlib2 release, but with no changes to the
code. This may change in the future if the imlib2 API changes.

Note: if you're trying to add .xcf file support to qiv, this package
won't help. Install xcf-pixbuf-loader instead.
