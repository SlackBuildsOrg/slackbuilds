# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

iotop-c: iotop-c (input/output top)
iotop-c:
iotop-c: iotop identifies processes that use high amount of input/output
iotop-c: requests on your machine.
iotop-c: It is similar to the well known top utility, but instead of showing
iotop-c: you what consumes CPU the most, it lists processes by their IO usage.
iotop-c: Inspired by iotop Python script from Guillaume Chazarain, rewritten
iotop-c: in C by Vyacheslav Trushkin and improved by Boian Bonev so it runs
iotop-c: without Python at all.
