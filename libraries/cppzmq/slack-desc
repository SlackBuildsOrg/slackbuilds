# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cppzmq: cppzmq (C++ binding for zmq)
cppzmq:
cppzmq: cppzmq is a C++ binding for libzmq. It has the following design goals:
cppzmq: It maps the libzmq C API to C++ concepts.
cppzmq: It is a light-weight, header-only binding. You only need to include
cppzmq: the header file zmq.hpp (and maybe zmq_addon.hpp) to use it.
cppzmq: zmq.hpp is meant to contain direct mappings of the abstractions
cppzmq: provided by the libzmq C API, while zmq_addon.hpp provides additional
cppzmq: higher-level abstractions.
