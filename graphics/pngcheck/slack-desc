# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pngcheck: pngcheck (check integrity of PNG files)
pngcheck:
pngcheck: pngcheck verifies the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files (by checking
pngcheck: the internal 32-bit CRCs, a.k.a. checksums, and decompressing the
pngcheck: image data); it can optionally dump almost all of the chunk-level
pngcheck: information in the image in human-readable form. For example, it can
pngcheck: be used to print the basic statistics about an image (dimensions,
pngcheck: bit depth, etc.); to list the color and transparency info in its
pngcheck: palette (assuming it has one); or to extract the embedded text
pngcheck: annotations. This is a command-line program with batch capabilities.
