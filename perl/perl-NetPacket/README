NetPacket - modules to assemble/disassemble network packets at the
protocol level.

NetPacket provides a base class for a cluster of modules related to
decoding and encoding of network protocols. Each NetPacket descendent
module knows how to encode and decode packets for the network protocol
it implements. Consult the documentation for the module in question
for protocol-specific implementation.

Note that there is no inheritance in the NetPacket:: cluster of
modules other than each protocol module being a NetPacket. This was
seen to be too restrictive as imposing inheritance relationships (for
example between the IP, UDP and TCP protocols) would make things like
tunneling or other unusual situations difficult.

This is not the same module as perl-Net-Packet!
