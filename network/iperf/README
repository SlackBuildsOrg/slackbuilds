Iperf is a tool to measure IP bandwidth using UDP or TCP. It allows
for tuning various parameters, and reports bandwidth, delay jitter,
and packet loss. It supports IPv6 and multicast. Iperf was developed
by NLANR/DAST as a modern alternative for measuring maximum TCP
and UDP bandwidth performance. Iperf allows the tuning of various
parameters and UDP characteristics. Iperf reports bandwidth, delay
jitter, datagram loss.
