Grig is a simple Ham Radio control (CAT) program based on the Ham
Radio Control Libraries (Hamlib). It is intended to be highly generic
presenting the user to the same graphical user interface regardless of
which radio is being controlled.

Grig supports the most commonly used CAT commands that are implemented
by Hamlib, and integrates well with other ham radio programs like Xlog
and gMFSK. Thanks to Hamlib, grig works with most CAT-capable amateur
radios. You can check out the Supported Radios page at the Hamlib
website.
