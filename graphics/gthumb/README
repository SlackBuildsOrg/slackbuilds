gThumb is an image viewer and browser for the GNOME desktop. It also
includes an importer tool for transferring photos from cameras.

gThumb supports printing multiple images on a single page using a
printer while many other image viewers don't support it.

clutter, brasero, and webkit2 are optional dependencies.
