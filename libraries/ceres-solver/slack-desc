# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ceres-solver: ceres-solver (Open Source Optimization Library)
ceres-solver:
ceres-solver: Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving
ceres-solver: large, complicated optimization problems.  It can be used to solve
ceres-solver: Non-linear Least Squares problems with bounds constraints and
ceres-solver: general unconstrained optimization problems. It is a mature,
ceres-solver: feature rich, and performant library that has been used in
ceres-solver: production at Google.
