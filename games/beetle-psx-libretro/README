Mednafen PSX (Beetle PSX) is a Sony PlayStation1 video game system
emulator that can be used as a libretro core. It is a libretro port of
Mednafen PlayStation.

Mednafen-PSX requires the following BIOS image files for operation:

* scph5500.bin (MD5 sum: 8dd7d5296a650fac7319bce665a6a53c) NTSC-J
* scph5501.bin (MD5 sum: 490f666e1afb15b7362b406ed1cea246) NTSC-U
* scph5502.bin (MD5 sum: 32736f17079d0b2b7024407c39bd3050) PAL

The bios names are case sensitive.

The scph7003.bin BIOS image is the same as scph5501.bin, but will need
to be renamed to scph5501.bin to be used.

Mednafen can load CD-ROM games from a ripped/dumped copy of the
disc such as CUE+BIN, CloneCD "CCD/IMG/SUB" rips and cdrdao "TOC"
files. For games with more than one CD create a M3U file(plain-text,
".m3u" extension) and enter the filenames of the CUE/TOC/CCD files.

Beetle PSX can use an OpenGL or Vulkan renderer instead of the
accurate software renderer. This will require support in the libretro
frontend, video card and driver.

To switch between OpenGL and Vulkan renderers configure the video
driver in RetroArch. This can be done in the menu at 'Settings >
Drivers > Video Driver'.

To build the OpenGL renderer use:
  OPENGL=1 ./beetle-psx-libretro.SlackBuild

To build the Vulkan renderer use:
  VULKAN=1 ./beetle-psx-libretro.SlackBuild

To build both the OpenGL and Vulkan renderers use:
  HW=1 ./beetle-psx-libretro.SlackBuild

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./beetle-psx-libretro.SlackBuild
