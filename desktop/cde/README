The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) was the dominant desktop on 
proprietary Unix systems in the 90's. In 2012 it was relicensed under 
GPL2 and has seen moderst maintenance from the community. Although
functional, it is of course a very old desktop, and some parts of it,
are not likely useful in a modern setting. Nevertheless, people still
use it today, for nostalgia, if nothing else.

PS: /etc/rc.d/rc.rpc needs to be running and configured correctly for the
calendar application to work; in practice though, both the calendar and
the main application are unlikely to be of any use in a modern setting.
There are security considerations too, especially with CDE's calendar
application. (NsCDE is a good alternative if you want a modern CDE
look-a-like)
