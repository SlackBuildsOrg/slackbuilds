# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nix: nix (Functional Package Manager)
nix:
nix: Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it treats
nix: packages like values in purely functional programming languages such
nix: as Haskell -- they are built by functions that don't have
nix: side-effects, and they never change after they have been built.
