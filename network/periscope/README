Periscope is a subtitles searching module written in python that
tries to find a correct match for a given video file. The subtitles
sites are handled as plugins and currently support OpenSubtitles,
SubtitleSource, Podnapisi, Subscene and Subtitulos.

A python/nautilus integration script is copied to the doc directory.

A rar unpacker is recommended, but it can be avoided if you disable the 
plugins for subtitles sites using this format.
