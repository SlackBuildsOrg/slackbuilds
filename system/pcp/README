RedHat Performance Co-Pilot is a distributed monitoring solution.

Essentially it is a turbocharged sysstat, with support for much
more sources of data than the sysstat originally provided.

1. Build and running requires a dedicated user add one like this:

groupadd -r -g 377 pcp
useradd -r -u 377 -g 377 -m -d /var/lib/pcp/tmp -s /bin/false \
  pcp

2. PCP conflicts with dstat, because it install (seemingly compatible)
binary with the same name.

3. Optional deps not on SBo: qt3d (for qt5)

4. Optional deps on SBo: libvirt-python, qt6(with qt3d), tsocks

5. This SlackBuild uses Slackware's SysV-Init support, in that
it installs the service files into /etc/rc.d/init.d/
If you need to enable any of them, you can add symlinks to them
in /etc/rc.d/rc$i.d, where $i is the runlevel, or you can call them
directly from rc.local.
