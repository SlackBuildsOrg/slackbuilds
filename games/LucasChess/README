Lucas Chess is a flexible and powerful chess software created by Lucas
Monge. It includes 61 pre-installed engines with a wide range of ELO
levels, including the neural network engines of the Maia project that
emulate human play based on a certain ELO. It also includes a wide
range of training modules to improve your chess skills. It can perform
game analysis, generate custom trainings based on your mistakes, read
PGN files, and study openings.

This SlackBuild repackages the binary distribution provided by
upstream. It requires about 700 MB of space when installed.

You will need a special group and to add at least the first user of
Lucas Chess to this group. By default, the group name is called
"lucaschess" with a group id of 385, but you can change this if you wish.
See the build script for more information.
