A Pure-Python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of:
 * extracting document information (title, author, ...)
 * splitting documents page by page
 * merging documents page by page
 * cropping pages
 * merging multiple pages into a single page
 * encrypting and decrypting PDF files

By being Pure-Python, it should run on any Python platform without
any dependencies on external libraries. It can also work entirely
on StringIO objects rather than file streams, allowing for PDF
manipulation in memory. It is therefore a useful tool for websites
that manage or manipulate PDFs.

NOTE: 
This is a fork of pypdf, which is available on SBo separately.

If any project has a dependency on PyPDF2 please link it
to this version.PyPDF2-1.26.0 will be now in maintenance
mode and is only needed for the dependee projects pdfshuffler
and odoo as they are hardlinked to that version.
