NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP (Usenet)
servers. Since NZB is XML-based, it's relatively easy to build one-off
parsers to parse NZB files. This project is an attempt to consolidate
those many one-off NZB parsers into one simple interface.

This package includes three implementations: one based on expat,
another based on ElementTree, and a final implementation based
on lxml. The order in which they were listed is in order of
compatibility. The expat version should work on all versions of Python
> 2.0, the lxml one will work on all versions > 2.5, and lxml will
only work if you have lxml installed.
