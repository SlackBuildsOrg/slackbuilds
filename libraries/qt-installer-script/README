qt-installer-script (Deploy Qt Libraries in Slackware)

qt-installer-script is an umbrella script to the standard Qt
installer to simplify the installation of Qt Libraries in your
Slackware system.

It is provided to perform and unattended install, define a
location (/opt/Qt) and setup a basic skeleton so you can add
several Qt library versions in parallel.

The script will download from Qt the online installer 4.8.0
labelled "qt-online-installer-linux-x64-4.8.0.run"

To install specific Qt libraries you can either:
1) Run the Qt MainenanceTool from the desktop menu icon
   or,
2) Run a bash script that will add a set of Qt Libraries specific
   for you application.

An install script example "qt-6.2.4-libraries-for-musescore.sh"
is included.

You will still need a Qt account in order to use this script.

Start by running "qt-installer-script" at the command prompt.
