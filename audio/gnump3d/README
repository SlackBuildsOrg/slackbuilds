GNUMP3d is a streaming server for MP3s, OGG vorbis files, movies and
other media formats.

It is designed to be:

    * Small, stable, portable, self-contained, and secure.
    * Simple to install, configure, and use.
    * Portable across different varieties of Unix, the GNU Operating
      System, and Microsoft Windows platforms.

The project has reached final release, thus there is no
immediate likelihood of upgrades, though I suspect if you find
a show-stopping bug, the author would like to know about it:
