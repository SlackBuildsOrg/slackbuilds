Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfies a coding
standard.

Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you can
do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. But Pylint offers some
more features, like checking line-code's length, checking if variable
names are well-formed according to your coding standard, or checking
if declared interfaces are truly implemented, and much more (see the
complete check list).

The big advantage with Pylint is that it is highly configurable,
customizable, and you can easily write a small plugin to add a
personal feature.
