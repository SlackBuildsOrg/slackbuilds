# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-libagent:
python3-libagent: This project allows you to use various hardware security devices
python3-libagent: to operate GPG, SSH and age. Instead of keeping your key on your
python3-libagent: computer and decrypting it with a passphrase when you want to use
python3-libagent: it, the key is generated and stored on the device and never reaches
python3-libagent: your computer.
