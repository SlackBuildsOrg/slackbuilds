zseal (open source client for FICS chess server)

Timeseal is a protocol for network lag reporting and compensation used
by the FICS chess server (freechess.org). Version 2 of the protocol
provides better delay stats as the server actively pings the client
periodically. FICS's FTP repository was taken down a few years ago
and was never put back on.  Since then, there has been nowhere to
download a trustable timeseal client for Linux systems.

To use with xboard, append "-icshelper zseal" to your normal xboard
command line:

  xboard -ics -icshost freechess.org -icsport 5000 -icshelper zseal

Assuming Slackware's gnuchess package is already installed on
your system, the install script will integrate and enable zseal in
eboard automatically. Otherwise, follow the instructions for eboard
configuration in /usr/doc/zseal-1.0/README.
