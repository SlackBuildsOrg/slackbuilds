raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames
programming and it is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib
and by XNA framework.

Set JARXM_LINEAR_INTERPOLATION=1 to patch jarxm to use linear
interpolation instead of no interpolation when playing back XM
(FastTracker II) music modules.

Set WAYLAND=1 to make Raylib work on Wayland instead of X11.
