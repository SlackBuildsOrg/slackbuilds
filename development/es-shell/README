Es is an extensible Unix shell with first class functions, lexical
scope, exceptions and rich return values. It is highly influenced by
Plan 9's rc shell, but also borrow ideas from scheme and tcl. It is
a small shell that works well both for interactive use and for
scripting, particularly since its quoting rules are much less
baroque.
