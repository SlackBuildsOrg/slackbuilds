tkcon itself provides many more features than the standard console
and works on all platforms where Tcl/Tk is available. It is meant 
primarily to aid one when working with the little details inside  
tcl and tk, giving Unix users the GUI console provided by default 
int the Mac and Windows Tk implementations.
