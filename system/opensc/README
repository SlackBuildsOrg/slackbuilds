SmartCard utilities/libraries for PKCS#11/15 compatible cards

This package provides a set of libraries and utilities to access
smart cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic
operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such
as mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC
implements the PKCS#11 API so applications supporting this API such
as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird can use it. OpenSC implements the
PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with every software that
does so, too.

You may need to edit /etc/opensc.conf in order to use a particular
backend and smartcard.

Beware! Smartcards have usually a limited number of times you may try a
wrong PIN/PUK combination before they become inoperable/permanently
blocked. You have been warned!

Since version 0.12.0, only one reader subsystem can be used and
compiled in at the same time. The PCSC-LITE subsystem is used by
default and it is suitable for most smartcards. If you need the
OPENCT subsystem instead, you have to pass "OPENCT=1" to the script
when building and have the optional dependency openct installed.
