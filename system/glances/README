glances is a free (LGPL), cross-platform, curses-based system
monitoring tool which aims to present a maximum of information in
a minimum of space, ideally to fit in a classical 80x24 terminal,
or larger for additional data. It can adapt the displayed information
dynamically, depending on the terminal size. A client/server mode is
also available and remote monitoring can be done via terminal or a web
interface.

glances is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch
statistical values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory,
network, disks, file systems, processes, etc.
