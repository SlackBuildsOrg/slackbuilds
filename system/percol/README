percol (interactive selection for UNIX pipes)

An interactive grep tool in your terminal. Percol does the following:

1. receives input lines from stdin or a file, 2. lists the input
lines, 3. waits for your input that filters/selects the line(s),
4. and finally outputs the selected line(s) to stdout.

Since percol just filters the input and outputs the result to
stdout, it can be used in command-chains with | in your shell (UNIX
philosophy!).

Package includes command completion for zsh, plus a /etc/percol.zsh
script that adds extra functionality (see the comments at the top of
the script for instructions on using it).

There is no man page; run "percol --help" for a list of options, and
read /usr/doc/percol-$VERSION/README.md for key bindings and examples.
