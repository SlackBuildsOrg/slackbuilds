sdltrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Macintosh
OSX, Windows and Linux. It has been ported from the excellent X
Window Unix emulator xtrs. Instead of using the X-Window system for
graphics, it uses the portable SDL library.

A simple sdltrs.desktop file is included that will start sdltrs
with the default options. Read the included documentation after
installation for more information.
