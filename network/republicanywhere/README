Republic Anywhere is an integrated technology platform that syncs your
phone number to all your devices and allows you to send and receive
text messages from your computer. You need a Republic Wireless account
to use this.

Note: during startup, it looks for /var/lib/dbus/machine-id'
(note trailing single quote). I'm not sure if that is a bug,
but it will work after copying /var/lib/dbus/machine-id to
/var/lib/dbus/machine-id'. (You will need to escape the quote in the
cp command.)
