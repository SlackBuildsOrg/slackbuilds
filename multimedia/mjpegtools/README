The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos
and playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression of
audio and video under Linux.

Recording is supported for the Zoran based cards like the Buz
(Iomega), DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle), Matrox Marvel cards and the LML33
(Linux Media Labs). See related pages to the right to find the right
driver for your card. The recorded videos can be converted to MPEG
streams. The software playback of MPEG streams works with almost every
player and every OS. You can produce special forms of MPEG streams
like VCD (Video CD) and SVCD for hardware playback.

This optionally depends on libquicktime, libdv and SDL_gfx.
