GAST provides a compatibility layer between the AST 
(Abstract Syntax Tree) of various Python versions, as produced by 
ast.parse from the standard ast module.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 0.5.5 due to breaking
python/python3-pythran. As of 19 JUL 24, only the master branch of
pythran supports gast 0.6.x.
