stubb (Stub file creator)

stubb is a command-line program written in Perl that can create stub
files and directories from pre-existing templates. stubb provides many
facilities for customizing the rendering of these templates, making it
well-suited to use for your templated file creation needs.

As a testament to the utility of stubb, this SlackBuild was created
from a stub generated by this program.
