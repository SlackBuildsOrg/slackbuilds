Blender is an integrated suite of free and open source tools enabling
the creation of a broad range of 3D content with the singular
benefits of cross-platform interoperability. It can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and cinema quality
video. It features fully integrated creation suite, offering a broad
range of essential tools for the creation of 3D content, including
modeling, uv-mapping, texturing, particle and other simulation,
scripting, rendering, compositing, post-production and game creation.

CUDA support is included if a CUDA installation is detected at build
time. It may be disabled by passing CUDA=no when building:
    CUDA=no sh ./Blender.SlackBuild

Since Blender-2.83.0, SBo's cudatoolkit-8.0.61 is insufficient for a
successful build. The CUDA handling above remains for cases which may:
    - use a newer CUDA version toolkit
    - require the existing cudatoolkit for other purposes
      (so need CUDA=no for Blender)

Support for embree may be disabled by passing EMBREE=no when building:
    EMBREE=no sh ./Blender.SlackBuild

Version 2.83.8 is the last SBo supported version of Blender for
building from source code in Slackware64-14.2. A more recent compiler
(gcc-9.3.1) is required for 2.90.x and later blender versions.
