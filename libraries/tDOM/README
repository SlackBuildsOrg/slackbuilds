tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and
powerful Tcl scripting functionality. tDOM should be one of the
fastest ways to manipulate XML with a scripting language and uses
very little memory in the process (for example the DOM tree of the
XML recommendation in XML (160K) needs only about 450K in memory)! The
tDOM project was started by Jochen Lower. It is currently maintained
by Rolf Ade.

Note, tDOM ships with two extensions: tnc, an XML validation module
and tdomhtml, a set of definitions for creating html documents using
tDOM. The slackbuild script builds and installs both by default.
If you do not wish to build one or both of these extensions then set
the BUILD_TNC and BUILD_TDOMHTML variables to false as appropriate.
