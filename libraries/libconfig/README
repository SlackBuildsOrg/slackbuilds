libconfig (library for processing structured configuration files)

Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML and
unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code.

It is very compact and well-suited for memory-constrained systems like
handheld devices.

The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages. It
works on POSIX-compliant UNIX systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris,
FreeBSD) and Windows (2000, XP and later).

To install the library documentation (HTML and PDF) pass DOC=yes to
the SlackBuild in the environment, e.g.:

   DOC=yes ./libconfig.SlackBuild
