buku (Cmdline bookmark manager with editor and browser integration)

buku is a powerful bookmark manager written in Python3 and SQLite3.
buku fetches the title of a bookmarked url and stores it along with
any user-provided comments and tags.

All buku dependencies must be built with Python 3.

Optional dependency: xsel

Note: pre-commit will not be updated any further in Slackware 15.0
since upstream have now dropped support for Python 3.9.
