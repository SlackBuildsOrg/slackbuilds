* tm - tmux manager/helper

This is a shell script used to ease day-to-day work with tmux
(included with Slackware). It allows easy handling of various types
of tmux sessions, as well as complex setups. It is mainly useful for
using tmux as a ssh-multiplexer and replacement for clusterssh though
its happy to do any other tmux session too.

"tm" can be driven directly from the command line or by using
repeatable session files. See /usr/doc/tm-yyyymmdd/README.org &
examples/

See README.SBo for post-install config instructions.
