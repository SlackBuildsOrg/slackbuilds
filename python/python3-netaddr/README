A pure Python network address representation and manipulation library.

netaddr provides a Pythonic way of working with :-
- IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets
- MAC addresses, OUI and IAB identifiers, IEEE EUI-64 identifiers
- arbitrary (non-aligned) IP address ranges and IP address sets
- various non-CIDR IP range formats such as nmap and glob-style formats

The source package includes (probably now out of date) data from:
1. https://standards-oui.ieee.org (public OUI and IAB registration data
published by the IEEE)
2. https://www.iana.org (IPv4, IPv6 and multicast address space
allocations).

To include the latest versions in the package, run the script with:

NEWDATA=yes ./python3-netaddr.SlackBuild

and the latest versions will be downloaded during the build
for inclusion in the package.
