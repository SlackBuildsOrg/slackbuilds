HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high
availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based
applications. It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites.

Note that a default configuration file is no longer provided at
/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg. See /usr/doc/haproxy-*/examples 
for some sample configuration files. The directory also contains 
example files for logging.

The script supports optional variables for Lua, PCRE and QUIC.
See README.SLACKWARE for more information.
