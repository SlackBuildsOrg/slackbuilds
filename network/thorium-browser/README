Thorium (The fastest browser on Earth)
---------------------------------------

Here's how to install Thorium on Slackware.

1. First, go to the Thorium releases section on github:

https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/releases

2. Choose between AVX, AVX2 or SSE3
  $ lscpu | egrep --color=always -o 'avx|avx2|sse3'
  avx
  avx2

In this case, my processor has support for avx and avx2. So I can go
for the AVX2 version.

Click the download button for the desired .deb package:

    < >  {_AVX, _AVX2, _SSE3}.deb (for Debian/Ubuntu)

3. Define `$ export CAP_EXT=AVX2`, be aware you have to choose
   one of these three cpu capabilities, i.e. CAP_EXT=AVX2

4. Then, with the thorium-browser_121.0.6167.204_${CAP_EXT}.deb
package in the same directory as the thorium-browser.SlackBuild
script, run the script as root to convert the .deb to a Slackware
.txz:

./thorium-browser.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version
of Thorium found in the .deb package, but it will be something
like: thorium-browser-121.0.6167.204_${CAP_EXT}-x86_64-1.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


5. Then, install the package (again as root):

$ PKGNAME=/tmp/thorium-browser-121.0.6167.204_${CAP_EXT}-x86_64-1.txz
$ upgradepkg --install-new $PKGNAME


Enjoy!  :-)
