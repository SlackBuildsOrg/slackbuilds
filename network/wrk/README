wrk (HTTP benchmarking tool)

A modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and
kqueue.

An optional LuaJIT script can perform HTTP request generation, response 
processing, and custom reporting.

Note: Lua and LuaJIT are not required here; wrk is statically-linked
against the LuaJIT version bundled in the upstream tarball.
