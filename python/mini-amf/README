Mini-AMF provides Action Message Format serialization and
deserialization support for Python, compatible with the Adobe Flash
Player.  It supports Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

Mini-AMF is a trimmed-down version of PyAMF. It provides only the
core serialization and deserialization primitives, and support for
reading and writing LSO objects on disk. Support for Flex-specific
types, "remoting", and integration with web frameworks has all been
removed. (Adapter classes are still supported.)
