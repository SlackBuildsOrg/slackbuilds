NSD is being developed with the purpose of creating more diversity
in the DNS landscape. Secondly we want to create a fast, modern, RFC
compliant nameserver.

NSD requires its own user in order to run securely. It is not advised
to run services as root user without special reason.

To add NSD user in system run as root:

# groupadd -g 336 nsd
# useradd -u 336 -d /var/lib/nsd -g nsd -s /bin/false nsd

In order to run NSD during boot process, add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.nsd ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.nsd start
fi
