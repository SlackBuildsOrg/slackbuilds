mate-desktop-environment (continuation of GNOME 2)

The MATE Desktop Environment provides an intuitive and attractive
desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and
other Unix-like operating systems while preserving a traditional
desktop experience.

By installing all packages listed by REQUIRES, 
a functional basic mate desktop is obtained.

To get a similar user experience as with the xfce-install-set,
additional packages(provided by SBo) are recommended:
-leafpad(minimal graphical text editor)
-mate-control-center
-mate-power-manager(policy agent on top of UPower)
-mate-terminal
-mate-utils(screenshot, disk-usage-analyzer, ...)
-mozo(menu editor using the freedesktop.org menu specification)

To bring even more mate flavour to your desktop, you might want
to install additional packages from the MATE-project(provided by SBo):
-atril(document viewer)
-engrampa(file archiver)
-mate-calc(graphical calculator)
