GDAL is a library for reading and writing raster geospatial data
formats, and is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by
the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a
single abstract data model to the calling application for all
supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful
command-line utilities for data translation and processing.

The related OGR library (which is part of the GDAL source tree)
provides a similar capability for simple features vector data.

The following optional requirements are detected automatically:

  hdf, postgresql, SFCGAL, libheif

To enable OpenCL GPU-accelerated performance, specify the option
OPENCL=yes (requires either nvidia-driver or amd-app-sdk with 
suitable GPU hardware to run).

To build JAVA bindings, specify JAVA=yes (it requires a java JDK and
ant).

By default, the script does not build nor run the tests. You can use the
option TESTBUILD=YES to build and run the tests before the make install
part. Tests are only present for the java bindings to this options does
nothing is the java bindings are not build.
