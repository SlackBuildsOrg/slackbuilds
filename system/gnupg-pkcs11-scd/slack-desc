# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gnupg-pkcs11-scd: gnupg-pkcs11-scd (PKCS#11 smart-card daemon for GnuPG)
gnupg-pkcs11-scd:
gnupg-pkcs11-scd: gnupg-pkcs11 is a project to implement a BSD-licensed smart-card
gnupg-pkcs11-scd: daemon to enable the use of PKCS#11 tokens with GnuPG.
gnupg-pkcs11-scd:
gnupg-pkcs11-scd: gnupg-pkcs11 is a (hopefully) drop-in replacement for the smart-card
gnupg-pkcs11-scd: daemon (scd) shipped with GnuPG.
