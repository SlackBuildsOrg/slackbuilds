clamav-unofficial-sigs provides a shell script to download, verify
(GPG) and integrate third-party clamav signatures into the clamav
database.  These third-party signatures provide valuable spam and
malware detection capabilities and make an excellent enhancement to
native clamav signatures.

It is especially useful when running a mailserver with clamav.
The best way to update signatures is to set up a cron job.

These sources are fully tweakable via the config file.  Also refer
to the documentation included with the package which provides
configuration and setup infomation.

The original script was from Bill Landry but it has not been updated
for a while now and so this new script from ExtremeSHOK is now the
recommended way to update third-party signature.  More information
is here:

A sample cron job script is included in the package docs -- but it
needs modifying to work with Slackware.
