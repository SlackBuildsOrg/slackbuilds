This is GDC (GNU D Compiler), the D frontend for GCC.

D is a general-purpose programming language with static typing,
systems-level access, and C-like syntax. It combines efficiency,
control and modeling power with safety and programmer productivity.

This package is for GCC 5.3.0 shipped with Slackware. It doesn't
replace any of GCC stock files, so it should be safe to uninstall it.
If it breaks your GCC installation nevertheless, please let me know.

GDC version provided by this package is the latest from the official
"gdc-5" branch. Please note that GDC doesn't support all the latest
features supported by the corresponding DMD version.

GDC doesn't conflict with DMD, they can be installed and used together.
