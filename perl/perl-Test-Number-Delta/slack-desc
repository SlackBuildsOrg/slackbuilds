# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Test-Number-Delta: perl-Test-Number-Delta (Compare the difference between numbers)
perl-Test-Number-Delta:
perl-Test-Number-Delta: At some point or another, most programmers find they need to compare
perl-Test-Number-Delta: floating-point numbers for equality. The typical idiom is to test
perl-Test-Number-Delta: if the absolute value of the difference of the numbers is within a
perl-Test-Number-Delta: desired tolerance, usually called epsilon. This module provides such
perl-Test-Number-Delta: a function for use with Test::Harness. Usage is similar to other test
perl-Test-Number-Delta: functions described in Test::More.
