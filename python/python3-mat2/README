Metadata and privacy

Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the
data that are being documented. Metadata within a file can tell a lot
about you. Cameras record data about when a picture was taken and what
camera was used. Office documents like PDF or Office automatically
adds author and company information to documents and spreadsheets.
Maybe you don't want to disclose those information.

This is precisely the job of mat2: getting rid, as much as possible,
of metadata.

mat2 provides:

a library called libmat2;
a command line tool called mat2,
a service menu for Dolphin, KDE's default file manager

If you prefer a regular graphical user interface, you might be
interested in Metadata Cleaner
(https://metadatacleaner.romainvigier.fr/ , not on SBo), which is
using mat2 under the hood.
