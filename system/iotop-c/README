iotop identifies processes that use high amount of input/output
requests on your machine.
It is similar to the well known top utility, but instead of showing
you what consumes CPU the most, it lists processes by their IO usage.
Inspired by iotop Python script from Guillaume Chazarain, rewritten
in C by Vyacheslav Trushkin and improved by Boian Bonev so it runs
without Python at all.

Note that this conflicts with iotop (install one of the two).
