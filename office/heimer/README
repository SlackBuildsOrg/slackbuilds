Heimer is a desktop application for creating mind maps and other 
suitable diagrams. It's written in Qt and targeted for Linux and 
Windows.

It's usually built against Qt 5 but you can enable the experimental Qt 
6 build by setting the cmake variable -DBUILD_WITH_QT6 to ON in the 
SlackBuild. In that case, qt6 is a dependency.
