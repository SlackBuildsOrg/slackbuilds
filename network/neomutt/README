Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt
is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with
advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading,
regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.

Optional dependencies:

* notmuch - fast mail indexer for maildir
* kyotocabinet - straightforward implementation of DBM
* lua53 - Powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting language
  NOTE: this won't work if you have multiple versions of lua installed.

This script builds neomutt without optional support
for idn2, notmuch, lua and kyotocabinet.
You can be enabled with:

# USENOTMUCH=yes USEKYOTO=yes USELUA=yes ./neomutt.SlackBuild
