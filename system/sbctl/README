sbctl (Secure Boot Manager)

sbctl intends to be a user-friendly secure boot key manager capable of
setting up secure boot, offer key management capabilities, and keep
track of files that needs to be signed in the boot chain.

It is written top-to-bottom in Golang using go-uefi for the API layer
and doesn't rely on existing secure boot tooling. It also tries to
sport some integration testing towards tianocore utilizing vmtest.
