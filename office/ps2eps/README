ps2eps is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript
Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It
calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters
some special postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous
results on printers. EPS files are often needed for including
(scalable) graphics of high quality into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word)
documents.

Without any argument, ps2eps reads from standard input and writes
to standard output. If filenames are given as arguments they are
processed one by one and output files are written to filenames with
extension .eps.  If input filenames have the extension .ps or .prn,
this extension is replaced with .eps. In all other cases .eps is
appended to the input filename. Please note that PostScript files
for input should contain only one single page (you can possibly use
the psselect from the psutils package to extract a single page from a
document that contains multiple pages).
