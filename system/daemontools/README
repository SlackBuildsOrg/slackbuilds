N.B. You probably only want to install this package if you aready run
qmail.

daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.

supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the
service if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise
needs is a directory with a run script that runs the service.

multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally
timestamps each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines
matching specified patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the
amount of disk space used. If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries
again, without losing any data.

Also included are svscan (starts one supervise process for each
service), svscanboot (run by init to start svscan in the /service
directory), readproctitle (show error messages in ps o/p) and many
others. See the home page for a list and for documentation.

daemontools was written by D. J. Bernstein.

N.B. Installing this package creates the 3 top-level directories
     /command, /package & /service. If any of these exist already,
     you need to consider your options.

----------------------------

If you build with

  EDIT_INITTAB=yes ./daemontools.SlackBuild

the following 2 items also apply:-

N.B. Installing this package modifies /etc/inittab.
N.B. Installing this package starts the svscanboot service,
     however it won't actually manage anything because there
     will be no symlinks in /service.

Otherwise, you will have to edit /etc/inittab yourself, as per the
instructions in README.SBo.

See README.SBo before attempting removepkg. upgradepkg is fine.
