aaphoto (automatic color correction of photo)

Auto Adjust Photo is a tiny command-line image manipulation tool for
automatic color correction of photos. It tries to make the picture
look better. The program analyzes the histogram of the image and tries
to set the most optimal black and white point of the image. It removes
the veiled effect caused by the shifted colors, adjusts the color
balance and saturation, and corrects the gamma factor.

This can be a solution for users who are not able to manage and
correct images with complicated graphical software, or just simply
don't intend to spend a lot of time manually correcting the images
one-by-one.

The program handles the following image formats: bmp, jpg, png.
