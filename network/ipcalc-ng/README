This is a modern tool to assist in network address calculations for
IPv4 and IPv6. It acts both as a tool to output human readable
information about a network or address, as well as a tool suitable to
be used by scripts or other programs.

It supports printing a summary about the provided network address,
multiple command line options per information to be printed,
transparent IPv6 support, and in addition it will use libGeoIP if
available to provide geographic information.

The project started as a fork of the ipcalc tool in the Fedora
distribution but it has since then replaced the original tool.

ipcalc-ng cannot be installed at the same time as ipcalc.
