persistent:  automatic persistence for Python objects

This package contains a generic persistence implementation for Python.
It forms the core protocol for making objects interact "transparently"
with a database such as the ZODB.

Please see the Sphinx documentation for further information, or view
the documentation at Read The Docs: https://persistent.readthedocs.io/
