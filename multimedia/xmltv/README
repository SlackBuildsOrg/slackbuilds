XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing.  They work with
TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The
idea is to separate out the back-end (getting the listings) from the
front-end (displaying them for the user), and to implement useful
operations like picking out your favorite programs as filters that
read and write XML documents.

At present there are back-ends grabbing TV listings for Australia,
Belgium and Luxembourg, Brazil, Argentina, Britain and Ireland,
Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary and
Romania, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, North America, Norway,
Portugal, Reunion Island (France), South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and
Switzerland.

See README.SBo for optional requirements for grabbers.
