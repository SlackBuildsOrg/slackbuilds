icinga2 (Network resource monitoring system)

Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system which checks the
availability of your network resources, notifies users of outages, and
generates performance data for reporting. Scalable and extensible,
Icinga 2 can monitor large, complex environments across multiple
locations.

MySQL presence on the build system will be auto detected, disable with:

  MYSQL=no ./icinga2.SlackBuild

PostgreSQL (optional dependency) can be enabled with:

  PGSQL=yes ./icinga2.SlackBuild

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
