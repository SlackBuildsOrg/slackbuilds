smenu (interactive selection filter)

smenu is a selection filter just like sed is an editing filter.

This tool reads words from standard input or from a file, and presents
them to the terminal screen in different layouts in a scrolling
window. A cursor, easily moved using the keyboard and/or the mouse,
makes it possible to select one or more words.
