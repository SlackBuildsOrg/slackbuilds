QB64 is a modern extended BASIC programming language that retains
QBasic/QuickBASIC 4.5 compatibility and compiles native binaries for
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The QB64 project has evolved over the last decade to bring the magic
and educational potential of BASIC from its 20th century roots into
the modern era. The QB64 project is already in use in both
educational and professional contexts and has an active and helpful
user community.

Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64 gets compiled
automatically into machine code â€“ allowing exceptional performance,
easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++
programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64
adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern
features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern
program development.

On first run this package installs ~/.config/qb64-(version)
in $HOME in order to run the program and its data.
You can delete this directory and rebuild you local configuration
by relaunching the program.
