lppf (Linux PPF Patcher)

lppf is an application for handling PPF patches in Linux. PPF patches
are often very small and are used for correcting a previously released
movie or an ISO, so that users won't have to download everything
again. PPF stands for "PlayStation Patch Format", though it can be
used for purposes other than PlayStation images.

To build with debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=yes ./lppf.SlackBuild
