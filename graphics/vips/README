libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing
library. Compared to similar libraries, libvips runs quickly and uses
little memory. libvips is licensed under the LGPL-2.1-or-later.

It has around 300 operations covering arithmetic, histograms,
convolution, morphological operations, frequency filtering, colour,
resampling, statistics and others. It supports a large range of numeric
types, from 8-bit int to 128-bit complex. Images can have any number of
bands. It supports a good range of image formats, including JPEG, JPEG
2000, JPEG XL, TIFF, PNG, WebP, HEIC, AVIF, FITS, Matlab, OpenEXR, PDF,
SVG, HDR, PPM / PGM / PFM, CSV, GIF, Analyze, NIfTI, DeepZoom, and
OpenSlide. It can also load images via ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick,
letting it work with formats like DICOM.

It comes with bindings for C, C++, and the command-line.
