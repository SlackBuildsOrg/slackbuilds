MySQL++ is a C++ wrapper for MySQL's C API. It is built around the
same principles as the Standard C++ Library, to make dealing with the
database as easy as dealing with STL containers. In addition, MySQL++
provides facilities that let you avoid the most repetitive sorts of
SQL within your own code, providing native C++ interfaces for these
common tasks.

MySQL++ requires MySQL.
