picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation program. It is, in
principle, very much like minicom, only it's pico instead of mini!

Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem
configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite
well) as a low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention
in PPP connection scripts (something like the ms-windows "open
terminal window before / after dialing" feature). It could also prove
useful in many other similar tasks.

Picocom is ideal for embedded systems since its memory footprint is
minimal (less than 20K, when stripped).

Apart from being a handy little tool, the picocom source
distribution includes a simple, easy to use, and thoroughly documented
terminal-management library, which could serve other projects as well.
This library hides the termios(3) calls, and provides a less complex
and safer (though certainly less feature-rich) interface.

Picocom runs on Linux, and with minor modifications it could run on any
Unix system with the termios(3) library.
