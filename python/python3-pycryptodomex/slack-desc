# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pycryptodomex: python3-pycryptodomex (Python Cryptography Toolkit)
python3-pycryptodomex:
python3-pycryptodomex: PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
python3-pycryptodomex: cryptographic primitives.  PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto.
python3-pycryptodomex:
python3-pycryptodomex: PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like OpenSSL.
python3-pycryptodomex: To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure
python3-pycryptodomex: Python.  Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance
python3-pycryptodomex: (e.g. block ciphers) are implemented as C extensions.
