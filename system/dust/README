Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are
using disk space without requiring sort or head.

Dust will list the 20 biggest sub directories or files and will
smartly recurse down the tree to find the larger ones. There is no
need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest sub directory will
have its size shown in red.
