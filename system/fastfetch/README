fastfetch (Like neofetch, but faster)

Fastfetch is a neofetch-like tool for fetching system information and 
displaying them in a pretty way. It is written mainly in C, with 
performance and customizability in mind.

This SlackBuild disables runtime detection for package managers that
would not be expected to be present on a Slackware system (like dpkg,
rpm, pacman, etc). If you would like to enable runtime detection for
any disabled package manager, you can run fastfetch with
  --packages-disabled ""
to re-enable detection.

ddcutil and chafa are optional dependencies.
