sbotools (ports-like interface to SlackBuilds.org)

sbotools is a set of Perl scripts providing a ports-like automation
interface to SlackBuilds.org. Features include dependency handling,
using a custom git branch, generating 32-bit and compat32 builds on
multilib systems, reverse dependency search and rebuild, dry run and
batch modes, gpg verification, optional build logging, checks for
missing shared object dependencies, and more.

Most sbotools operations can be accomplished with sbotool, a dialog TUI
with dynamic menus. Running the tools individually from the command line
provides superior option control and efficiency, however.

Each included tool has a man page. See sbotools(1) for executive
summaries and a startup guide. The modules are documented in man 3.

To blacklist scripts, notify sbotools of optional dependencies and
request automatic reverse dependency rebuilds, see sbohints(1) or
/etc/sbotools/sbotools.hints.

Please note that this implementation of sbotools was forked from
sbotools-2.7 and added to SlackBuilds.org in late 2024. Configuration
files from version 2.7 are compatible, but some of the options are new.
A debt of gratitude is owed to original author Jacob Pipkin, longtime
maintainer Andreas Guldstrand and major contributor Luke Williams.

sbotools conflicts with system/sbotools2 (Legacy Sbotools).
