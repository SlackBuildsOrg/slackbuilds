Statsmodels is a Python module that allows users to explore data,
estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.

An extensive list of descriptive statistics, statistical tests,
plotting functions, and result statistics are available for
different types of data and each estimator. Researchers across
fields may find that statsmodels fully meets their needs for
statistical computing and data analysis in Python.

python3-statsmodels 0.14.1 is the last available version for Slackware
15.0. Newer versions would require Cython >= 3.0.10.
