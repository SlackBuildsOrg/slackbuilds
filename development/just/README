just is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.

The program has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over
make:
 - just is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of
    make's complexity and idiosyncrasies. No need for .PHONY recipes!
 - Linux, MacOS, Windows, and other reasonable unices are supported
    with no additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn't have an sh, you'll need to choose a different shell.)
 - Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are
    reported along with their source context.
 - Recipes can accept command line arguments.
 - Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes
    and circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.
 - just loads .env files, making it easy to populate environment
    variables.
 - Recipes can be listed from the command line.
 - Command line completion scripts are available for most popular
shells.
 - Recipes can be written in arbitrary languages, like Python or
    NodeJS.
 - just can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory 
    that contains the justfile.

NOTE: The 15.0 version of rust _will_not_ compile this application.
Install the rust-opt package (which should be at least 1.77.0) and
add that package's 'bin/' and 'lib64/' path to the PATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
    PATH="/opt/rust/bin:$PATH" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/rust/lib64" \
    just.SlackBuild
