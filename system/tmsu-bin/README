TMSU is a tool for tagging your files. It provides a simple
command-line tool for applying tags and a virtual filesystem so that
you can get a tag-based view of your files from within any other
program.

TMSU does not alter your files in any way: they remain unchanged on
disk, or on the network, wherever you put them. TMSU maintains its own
database and you simply gain an additional view, which you can mount,
based upon the tags you set up. The only commitment required is your
time and there's absolutely no lock-in.

This SlackBuild repackages the official binary tarball.
