stem is a Python controller library for Tor

stem is compatible with python 2.6+ (including python 3)
Please note that stem by now is defacto unmaintained.

Having Tor installed is not required for building.
The Tor installation does not have to be from SBo.

A python 3 module will be compiled.
In case you need a python 2 module, adapt the script.
