lib3mf is a C++ implementation of the 3D Manufacturing Format file
standard.

It provides 3MF reading and writing capabilities, as well as conversion
and validation tools for input and output data.  lib3mf runs on Windows,
Linux and MacOS and offers a clean and easy-to-use API in various
programming languages to speed up the development and keep integration
costs at a minimum.

As 3MF shall become an universal 3D Printing standard, its quick
adoption is very important. This library shall lower all barriers of
adoption to any possible user, let it be software providers, hardware
providers, service providers or middleware tools.
