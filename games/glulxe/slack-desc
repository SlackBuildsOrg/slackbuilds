# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

glulxe: glulxe (interactive fiction VM)
glulxe:
glulxe: Glulx is a portable VM, like the Z-machine. Unlike the Z-machine, it
glulxe: uses 32-bit data and addresses, so it can handle game files up to four
glulxe: gigabytes long. Also unlike the Z-machine, it has native support for
glulxe: Glk I/O, so game files can use any capability Glk provides. However,
glulxe: like the Z-machine -- again -- you can write games in the Inform
glulxe: language and compile them to Glulx game files.
glulxe:
glulxe: This package @INCREM@ glulxe-remglk.
glulxe: This package @INCCG@ glulxe-cheapglk.
