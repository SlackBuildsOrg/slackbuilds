xbill (stop Bill from loading his OS into all the computers.)

The xbill game tests your reflexes as you seek out and destroy all
forms of Bill, establish a new operating system throughout the
universe, and boldly go where no geek has gone before. Xbill has
become an increasingly attractive option as the Linux Age progresses,
and it is very popular at Red Hat.
