Subsurface is able to track single- and multi-tank dives using air,
Nitrox or TriMix. It also allows logging of weights and exposure
protection used, dive masters and dive buddies and enables the user to
rate dives and provide additional dive notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also conveniently be entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and calculates and tracks information like the user's SAC
rate, partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information,
and many more.

Optional dependencies: libftdi or libftdi1

Note: To build Subsurface with libftdi support pass FTDI="yes" to
the SlackBuild. libftdi will be used if both libftdi and libftdi1 are
installed on the system.

  # FTDI="yes" ./subsurface.SlackBuild

Note: To build with QWebEngine instead of QtWebKit, pass QWEBENGINE=yes
to the slackbuild:

  # QWEBENGINE="yes" ./subsurface.SlackBuild
