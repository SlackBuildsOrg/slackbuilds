Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer")
source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several
languages.
Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by
GNU General Public License.

You can modify the laucher bash script to fit your needs.
Have a look at the included notepad++ and the SlackBuild.

Once installed Notepad++ will update itself following from the
regular updates from the upstream author, even if this SlackBuild
is updated. To bypass this you should manually remove Notepad++
from your ".wine" setup.
