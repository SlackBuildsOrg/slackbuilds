The Webcore Fonts package contains:

* Microsoft's Core Fonts for the web
* Microsoft Tahoma
* Microsoft's new fonts for Windows Vista
* Lucida Console

Before installing these, please remove the following file:

  /etc/fonts/conf.d/60-liberation.conf".

That file causes Slackware to display Liberation fonts in the place of
Microsoft fonts. If you have Microsoft fonts, you don't need the
substitutions.

FontForge is an optional dependency. The distribution includes the
Cambria font as a .TTC file consisting of two fonts: cambria.ttf and
cambria-math.ttf. If FontForge is available, then the Cambria font
will be installed as these two TTF files. If not, then it will be
installed as a single TTC file.

The following Fontconfig setting (taken from infinality.net)
is recommended. Put it in /etc/fonts/local.conf or
~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf:

   <!-- Disable embedded bitmaps in fonts like Calibri -->
  <match target="font" >
    <edit name="embeddedbitmap" mode="assign">
      <bool>false</bool>
    </edit>
  </match>
