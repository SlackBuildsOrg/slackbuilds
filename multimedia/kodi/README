Kodi is an award winning media center application for Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows and XBox. The ultimate hub for all your media, Kodi is easy to
use, looks slick, and has a large helpful community.  Kodi supports
viewing and playing a vast library of audio, video and image formats.
Kodi has a sophisticated library management system that allows you to
organize all your media to give you quick and immediate access.

Optional autodetected dependencies:
avahi - Network discovery
cwiid - Controller support
dav1d - AV1 codec support
libcec - CEC support
libmicrohttpd - Web interface support
libnfs - Browse NFS shares
lirc - Remote support
shairplay - Airplay Support
waylandpp - Early wayland support

NOTE:
Kodi can be compiled with jdk11 instead of zulu-openjdk11.

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
If you are having issues with addons crashing, please ensure you're
upgraded to at least python3-3.9.14 or later from the patches/
directory on your favorite mirror. 3.9.12 and earlier had issues.

FINAL NOTE:
If you are running into issues with playing certain formats that should
be supported due to optional dependencies (I had issues with AV1
content even with dav1d installed until I rebuilt ffmpeg), you may need
to rebuild Slackware's ffmpeg to add that support or use Kodi's
internal version by passing FFMPEG=internal to the SlackBuild script
(this will cause the kodi build system to require internet access so
root can download ffmpeg).
