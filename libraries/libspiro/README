Spiro is the creation of Raph Levien which simplifies the
drawing of beautiful curves.Using Bezier splines a artist can
easily draw curves with the same slope on either side of a curve
point. This library will take an array of spiro control points and
convert them into a series of bezier splines which can then be used
in myriad of ways the world has come to use beziers.
