This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug
registers and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6
(AMDTP). Outside of IIDC, nearly all FireWire multimedia devices use
IEC 61883 protocols.

The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception
and transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer.
