portaudio (cross-platform audio I/O library)

PortAudio provides a very simple API for recording and/or playing
sound using a simple callback function or a blocking read/write
interface. Example programs are included that play sine waves, process
audio input (guitar fuzz), record and playback audio, list available
audio devices, etc.

By default, the example programs are not installed. To include them in
the package, run the script with EXAMPLES=yes set in the environment.

Optional dependency: jack (autodetected).
