zaz (action/puzzle game)

Zaz is a game where the player has to get rid of incoming balls by
arranging them in triplets. The idea of the game is loosely based on
games like Luxor, Zuma, Puzz Loop, and Puzzle Bobble. The twists that
make Zaz stand out from other games of this type are that the balls
have to be picked from the path (insted of being randomly assigned for
the player) and that the player's "vehicle" is also attached to a path
which is different from level to level.
