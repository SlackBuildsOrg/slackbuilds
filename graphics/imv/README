imv (image viewer for X and/or Wayland)

imv is a command line image viewer intended for use with tiling window
managers. Features:

* Native Wayland and X11 support
* Support for dozens of image formats including:
  * PNG
  * JPEG
  * Animated GIFs
  * SVG
  * TIFF
  * WEBP
  * QOI
  * BMP (requires libnsbmp)
  * HEIF/AVIF (requires libheif)
  * JXL (requires libjxl)
* Configurable key bindings and behaviour
* Highly scriptable with IPC via imv-msg

Optional dependencies (autodetected):

- libnsbmp (support for BMP aka Windows bitmap)
- libheif (support for HEIF/AVIF)
- libjxl (support for JXL aka JPEG XL)

Note: Previous versions of imv supported RAW and PSD files, with
the optional dependency FreeImage. The imv maintainer has removed
FreeImage support, due to unpatched vulnerabilites.
