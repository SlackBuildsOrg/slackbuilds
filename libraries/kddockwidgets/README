KDDockWidgets is a Qt dock widget library written by KDAB, suitable for
replacing QDockWidget and implementing advanced functionalities missing
in Qt.

KDDockWidgets was created by KDABâ€™s senior software engineer, Sergio
Martins. It was born from the frustration he experienced from working
with QDockWidget on projects that needed extensive customization. (Read
his blog about it). Specific requests increasingly made it clear that a
better docking framework was needed.
