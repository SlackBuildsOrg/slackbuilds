# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike:
perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike: This module provides a possibility to build your own set of Moose-like
perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike: types. These custom types can then be used to describe fields in
perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike: Moo-based classes.
perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike:
perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike: See MooX::Types::MooseLike::Base for a list of available base types.
perl-MooX-Types-MooseLike: Its source also provides an example of how to build base types, along
