AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is
a backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a
single master backup server to back up multiple hosts to a single
large capacity tape drive. AMANDA uses native dump and/or GNU tar
facilities and can back up a large number of workstations running
multiple versions of Unix. Recent versions can also use SAMBA to back
up Microsoft Windows hosts.

You will need to have a special user and group created for AMANDA to
use; this defaults to user and group of "amanda" but you can specify
whatever group you wish - see the build script for more information.

After installing, see the /usr/doc/amanda-3.3.0/README.Slackware for
more information on how to modify inetd.conf to start the the Amanda
daemons automatically at boot.
