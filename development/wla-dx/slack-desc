# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wla-dx: wla-dx (Yet Another Multi Platform Cross Assembler Package)
wla-dx:
wla-dx: WLA DX is a set of tools to assemble assembly files to object or
wla-dx: library files (wla-ARCH) and linking them together (wlalink). WLA
wla-dx: DX isn't bound to one system (eg. NES or C64), but rather WLA DX
wla-dx: allows you to define your own memory map (that should be shared
wla-dx: across all object and library files).
