Textadept is a fast, minimalist, and remarkably extensible
cross-platform text editor for programmers.

Written in a combination of C and Lua and relentlessly optimized for
speed and minimalism over the years, Textadept is an ideal editor for
programmers who want endless extensibility without sacrificing speed
or succumbing to code bloat and featuritis.

The following executables are symlinked from /usr/share/textadept/
to /usr/bin/:

  -textadept
  -textadept-gtk
  -textadept-curses
  -tad
  -tadc
  -tadg

Note that `tad`, `tadg` and `tadc` are just easier ways to type
`textadept`, `textadept-gtk` and `textadept-curses`, respectively.

python3-markdown-it-py is only required for building HTML
documentation, and the scripts works fine without it.
But since the local HTML pages are opened when using the menu/help,
it is not marked as optional.
