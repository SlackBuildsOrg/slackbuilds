GNU rush is a Restricted User Shell, designed for sites providing
limited remote access to their resources, e.g. scp, sftp, or access
to VCS repositories over ssh. Accounts of the users that are allowed
remote access to the machine are configured to use /sbin/rush as the
login shell.

Using a flexible configuration file, GNU rush gives administrators
complete control over the commands that users are allowed to run and
their possible arguments. It also makes it possible to run commands
in chrooted environments, limit usage of system resources, and do
various other administrative tasks.
