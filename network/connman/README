connman (Connection management daemon)

Connman provides a daemon for managing Internet connections. The 
Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to use as few resources 
as possible. It is fully modular system that can be extended through 
plug-ins. The plug-in approach allows for easy adaption and 
modification for various use cases. Connman implements DNS resolving 
and caching, DHCP clients for both IPv4 and IPv6, link-local IPv4 
address handling and tethering (IP connection sharing) to clients via 
USB, ethernet, WiFi, cellular and Bluetooth.

To run connman on startup, run (as root):
  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.connmand
Make sure other networking services like NetworkManager or WPA
Supplicant are not also configured to run on startup.

By default, this SlackBuild will build connman with support for iwd,
polkit, and nmcompat (NetworkManager compatibility interfaces). If
you wish to disable any of these, you may run the SlackBuild with
the DISABLE_IWD, DISABLE_POLKIT, and DISABLE_NMCOMPAT environment
variables set, e.g.
  DISABLE_IWD=yes DISABLE_POLKIT=yes DISABLE_NMCOMPAT=yes \
  ./connman.SlackBuild
