A simple converter from OpenDocument Text to plain text odt2txt is
a command-line tool which extracts the text out of OpenDocument Texts
produced by OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, KOffice and others.

odt2txt can also extract text from some file formats similar to
OpenDocument Text, such as OpenOffice.org XML (*.sxw), which was
used by OpenOffice.org version 1.x and older StarOffice versions. To
a lesser extent, odt2txt may be useful to extract content from
OpenDocument spreadsheets (*.ods) and OpenDocument presentations
(*.odp).
