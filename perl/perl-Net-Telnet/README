Net::Telnet - interact with TELNET port or other TCP ports

Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do
network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol. Simple
I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided. More
sophisticated interactive features are provided because connecting to
a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a program designed
for human interaction. These interactive features include the ability
to specify a time-out and to wait for patterns to appear in the input
stream, such as the prompt from a shell.
