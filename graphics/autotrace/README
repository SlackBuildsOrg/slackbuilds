AutoTrace is a utility for converting bitmap into vector graphics.

Features:
- Tracing outline and midline
- Color reduction and Despeckling
- Supports a lot of input and output formats

NOTE: AutoTrace will use SBo's graphics/GraphicsMagick if installed,
otherwise it will default to Slackware's stock ImageMagick.
