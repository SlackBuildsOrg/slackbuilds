Field3D is an open source library for storing voxel data. It provides
C++ classes that handle in-memory storage and a file format based on
HDF5 that allows the C++ objects to be written to and read from disk.

Field3d is an optional run-time dependency of Houdini, which is not
available on SBo, but can be downloaded and used free of charge.
