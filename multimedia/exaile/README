Exaile is a music manager and player for GTK+ written in Python. It
incorporates automatic fetching of album art, handling of large
libraries, lyrics fetching, artist/album information via Wikipedia,
and Last.fm submission support.

Optional dependencies are (/usr/doc/exaile-*/DEPS):
-pylast (Last.FM integration)
-lxml (Lyrics)
-musicbrainzngs + python-discid (Musicbrainz covers)
-streamripper (to record streams)
-Sphinx plus sphinx_rtd_theme (Documentation).

INFO: Exaile now uses an SQLite database for the music library,
  replacing Berkeley DB. Note that you still need the Python bsddb3
  or berkeleydb module installed in order to migrate your existing
  library to the new format; without it, Exaile will fail to start.
