# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cheapglk: cheapglk (cheapass implementation of the Glk API)
cheapglk:
cheapglk: This is the simplest possible implementation of the Glk API. It uses
cheapglk: stdio.h calls (fopen, putc, getc), but not any of the curses.h calls
cheapglk: (which handle cursor movement and unbuffered keyboard input.) So
cheapglk: there's no way it can support multiple windows, or a status bar. In
cheapglk: fact, this library only allows you to create *one* window at a time,
cheapglk: and that must be a TextBuffer. Fortunately -- well, deliberately --
cheapglk: TextBuffer windows are very simple; all the library has to be able to
cheapglk: do is printf() straight to stdout.
