iniconfig (brain-dead simple config-ini parsing)

iniconfig is a small and simple INI-file parser module having a unique
set of features:

* maintains order of sections and entries
* supports multi-line values with or without line-continuations
* supports "#" comments everywhere
* raises errors with proper line-numbers
* no bells and whistles like automatic substitutions
* iniconfig raises an Error if two sections have the same name.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions due to requiring newer version
of python than is available in Slackware 15.0 (python 3.10).
