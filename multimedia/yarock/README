Yarock is a modern looking music player, packed with features,
that doesn't depend on any specific desktop environment.  Yarock is
designed to provide an easy and pretty music browser based on cover
art.

NOTE: You can build yarock with an alternate audio engine (phonon is
the default), by editing the SlackBuild. If you want to disable phonon
just use -DENABLE_PHONON=OFF as a cmake option. For vlc audio engine
-DENABLE_VLC=ON. For mpv audio engine -DENABLE_MPV=ON.
