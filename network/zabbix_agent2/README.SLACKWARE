README.Slackware
================

This file contains some specific instructions to complete the
installation of zabbix_agent2 on Slackware.

0) Before running the SlackBuild script
---------------------------------------

0.1) zabbix group & user

Before running the zabbix_agent2.SlackBuild script, you will need to create
the 'zabbix' user and group as well as 'zabbixagent' user. The script won't
run if these do not exist.

The suggested UID and GID is 228 for 'zabbix' and 266 for 'zabbixagent',
but you can change this as needed:

  # groupadd -g 228 zabbix
  # useradd -u 266 -g zabbix -d /dev/null -s /bin/false zabbixagent

1) Configuring zabbix_agent2
----------------------------

A standard configuration file is installed as /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent2.conf

At least the following lines need to be configured:
 For passive checks:
  Server=<ip_of_your_zabbix_server>
 For active checks
  Hostname=<hostname_of_your_zabbix_agent>
  ServerActive=<ip_of_your_zabbix_server>

2) Start & Stop scripts for zabbix agent daemon
-----------------------------------------------

2.1) Automatic startup and shutdown

If you want to start zabbix_agent2 on system bootup, include these lines in
your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  # Start zabbix_agent2
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2]; then
    echo "Starting zabbix agent daemon..."
    /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2 start
  fi

To guarantee a clean shutdown of zabbix_agent2, include this in
/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

  # Stop zabbix_agent2
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2 ]; then
    echo "Stopping zabbix agent daemon..."
    /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2 stop
  fi

2.2) Make /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2 executable

Additionally, you'll have to set the rc script to be executable just like
any other Slackware rc script:

  # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2

3) Starting zabbix agent daemon
-------------------------------

Now you are ready to start zabbix_agent2 by calling the startup script:

  # /etc/rc.d/rc.zabbix_agent2 start

You can check the log file (/var/log/zabbix/zabbig_agent2.log) in case of
problems.

Zabbix uses ports 10050 & 10051 to communicate, so make sure these aren't
blocked on your network.
