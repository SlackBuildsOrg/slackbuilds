PrismLauncher (An Open Source Minecraft launcher)

An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free
redistributability.

A Microsoft or Mojang account that owns Minecraft is required to
download and play the game through PrismLauncher.

Other versions of Java may work, though it is recommended to compile
PrismLauncher with OpenJDK17. Your JAVA_HOME environment variable
determines which version of Java will be used.
