moreutils is a growing collection of the unix tools that nobody
thought to write long ago when unix was young.

perl-IPC-Run is an optional dependency, if it's missing chronic will
not be installed.

This package conflicts with system/parallel so moreutils version of
parallel is not installed by default. To install it:

  PARALLEL=yes ./moreutils.SlackBuild
