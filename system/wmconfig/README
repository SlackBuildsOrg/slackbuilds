wmconfig is a free tool for automatically generating menus for various
X window managers. It uses a very simple configuration, it's fast and
small. A special toolkit (Gtk or Qt/KDE) is not required and the menu
entries may be edited with the text editor of your choice.

wmconfig will read the application template files located in
/etc/wmconfig and add an entry into the menu if that application is
found on your system.  It will also read the application template
files from the .wmconfig directory in the user's home directory.
Therefore, the user's settings will override the system-wide
settings. If optionally any extra files are given as an argument on
the command line, those will be read last and merged with the others
(possibly overriding the settings in system and user home dir files).

To set a default terminal other than xterm for programs that require
it, pass TERMINAL=urxvt (or any other terminal) to the build script.
The terminal option (--terminal) can also be set at runtime.

wmconfig creates menus for the following window managers/desktop
environments:

debug, fvwm95, fvwm2, afterstep, mwm, icewm, blackbox, wmaker, twm,
olwm, olvwm, fvwm, mlvwm, kde1, kde2, kde3, kde4, qvwm, pekwm, golem,
