# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-PerlIO-Layers: perl-PerlIO-Layers (Perl module)
perl-PerlIO-Layers:
perl-PerlIO-Layers: Perl's filehandles are implemented as a stack of layers, with the
perl-PerlIO-Layers: bottom-most usually doing the actual IO and the higher ones doing
perl-PerlIO-Layers: buffering, encoding/decoding or transformations. PerlIO::Layers
perl-PerlIO-Layers: allows you to query the filehandle's properties concerning these
perl-PerlIO-Layers: layers.
