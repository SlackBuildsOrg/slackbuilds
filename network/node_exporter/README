Node exporter is a Go program that collects and exports metrics from
 *NIX kernels to Prometheus. It supports various collectors for CPU, 
disk, network, filesystem, and more.

To have the node_exporter daemon start with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.node_exporter ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.node_exporter start
  fi

To enable TLS, create file /etc/node_exporter/web.yml containing:

  tls_server_config:
    cert_file: /etc/node_exporter/node_exporter.crt
    key_file: /etc/node_exporter/node_exporter.key

and place key and cert to the same directory.
In /etc/default/node_exporter modify NODE_EXPORTER_ARGS to:

  NODE_EXPORTER_ARGS="--web.config.file=/etc/node_exporter/web.yml"


NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not needed for
runtime.
