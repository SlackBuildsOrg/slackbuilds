STM32CubeIDE is an advanced C/C++ development platform with peripheral
configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features
for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It is based on
the ECLIPSE/CDT framework and GCC toolchain for the development,
and GDB for the debugging.

STM32CubeIDE integrates STM32 configuration and project creation
functionalities from STM32CubeMX to offer all-in-one tool experience
and save installation and development time.

STM32CubeIDE includes build and stack analyzers that provide the user
with useful information about project status and memory requirements.

STM32CubeIDE also includes standard and advanced debugging features
including views of CPU core registers, memories, and peripheral
registers, as well as live variable watch, Serial Wire Viewer
interface, or fault analyzer.

NOTE:

- The source tarball has to be downloaded manually from the website.
