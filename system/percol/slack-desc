# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

percol:
percol: An interactive grep tool in your terminal. Percol does the following:
percol:
percol: 1. receives input lines from stdin or a file, 2. lists the input
percol: lines, 3. waits for your input that filters/selects the line(s),
percol: 4. and finally outputs the selected line(s) to stdout.
percol:
percol: Since percol just filters the input and outputs the result to
percol: stdout, it can be used in command-chains with | in your shell (UNIX
percol: philosophy!).
