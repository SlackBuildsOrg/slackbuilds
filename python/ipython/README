IPython is a replacement shell for Python programming. It offers an
enhanced Python shell for the terminal.

This package no longer provides IPython notebook functionality. This is
now provided with the jupyter-notebook and jupyter-ipykernel packages.

python3-black is an optional dependency (for automatic code formatting).

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 8.18.x due to requiring a
newer python than included in Slackware (needs 3.10).
