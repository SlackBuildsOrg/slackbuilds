Nextcloud is a safe home for all your data - community-driven, free and
open source. Nextcloud gives you access to all your files wherever you
are.

Optional dependency: it will need php81 from /extra in place of
Slackware's stock php-7.4.x. php82 or postgresql from SBo can also be
used as the server's database.
