VirtualXT is an IBM PC/XT (8088/V20) emulator that runs on modern
hardware and operating systems. It is designed to be simple and
lightweight yet still capable enough to run a large library of old
applications and games.

VirtualXT uses a module system that loads dynamic plugins, which are
files that end with an extension of .vxt. By default, all modules will
be built. Modules may be excluded by using the EXCLUDE_MODULES variable.

For example:

EXCLUDE_MODULES=network ./virtualxt.SlackBuild

More than one module can be excluded as long as each module is separated
by a comma.

For example:

EXCLUDE_MODULES=fdc,network ./virtualxt.SlackBuild

The following modules cannot be excluded:

adlib
arstech_isa
cga
ch36x_isa
chipset
ctrl
disk
ems
joystick
mouse
rifs
serial_dbg

The virtualxt binary is built with an SDL2 frontend and meant to be run
by a non-root user. The user will need to be added to the "users"
group because the binary will open the provided boot images in read-
write mode and "users" has write access to those images.

For example:

usermod -aG users bob

The user's current working directory must be the same directory where
the virtualxt binary is installed. Because of this requirement, the
binary cannot be installed to a traditional location (e.g. /usr/bin/).

A wrapper script, virtualxt-wrapper.sh, has been provided so that the
user does not have to change to the directory where the virtualxt
binary is installed. This wrapper script may be found in
/usr/share/virtualxt/ and copied to a traditional location for
storing binaries.

For example:

cp /usr/share/virtualxt/virtualxt-wrapper.sh \
  /usr/bin/virtualxt-wrapper.sh
chmod +x /usr/bin/virtualxt-wrapper.sh

The wrapper script may then be executed as if the user's current
working directory is actually the directory where the virtualxt binary
is installed.

For example:

virtualxt-wrapper.sh -a boot/freedos.img

If after upgrading from a previous version of virtualxt the console
fails to start, then you may need to generate a new config file as
follows:

virtualxt-wrapper.sh --clean
