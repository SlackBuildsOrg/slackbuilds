Nastaliq  also romanized as Nastaʿlīq or Nastaleeq,
is one of the main calligraphic hands used to write the
Perso-Arabic script and it is used for some
Indo-Iranian languages, predominantly Classical Persian,
Kashmiri, Punjabi (Shahmukhi) and Urdu (Hindustani).
It is often used also for Ottoman Turkish poetry,
but rarely for Arabic. Nastaliq developed in Iran from
naskh beginning in the 13th century
and remains widely used in Iran, Afghanistan, India,
Pakistan, and other countries for written poetry and
as a form of art.
