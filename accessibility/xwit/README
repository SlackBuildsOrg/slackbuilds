xwit (X Window Interface Tool)

xwit is a hodge-podge collection of simple routines to call some
of those X11 functions that don't already have any utility commands
built around them. The reasoning behind this is that loosely every X
function should be accessible from a shell script.

Note: xwit is old and mostly unmaintained. It's included only for
compatibility with old scripts that use it. New software should use
xdotool rather than xwit.
