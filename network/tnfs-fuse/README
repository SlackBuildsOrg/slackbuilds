tnfs-fuse (client for trivial network filesystem)

TNFS is a simplified Internet file transfer protocol, designed for
limited resource usage and ease of implementation on small systems,
such as 8-bit computers. It's simpler than NFS, SMB, or FTP. It's
similar to TFTP, but has features TFTP lacks.

This package is the Linux (and Mac, *BSD, etc) client.
