libresprite: libresprite

LibreSprite is a free and open source program to create and animate
sprites. LibreSprite was forked from Aseprite in 2016 after Aseprite
changed its license and moved from GPL2 to a proprietary one.

This SlackBuild builds the entire project from its source code. Most
third party features are included by default using internal versions of
any external software components that may be needed. Some additional
software packages are still needed however: googletest (gtest),
simpleini and tinyxml2.

NodeJS is an optional dependency you should install to add support to
scripting in JavaScript. The webp image format is another optional
dependency. Both NodeJS and Webp will be detected by CMake and used
when available.
