minipro is an open source program for controlling the MiniPRO TL866xx
series of chip programmers.

This program exists because the manufacturer of the MiniPRO TL866xx
series of chip programmers does not provide a program for use on Linux
or other flavors of Unix.  We who keep this project going prefer a
simple, free, and open-source program that presents a command-line
interface that allows for a GUI front-end if desired.

Features

- Native support for Linux, BSD, and other flavors of Unix.
- Compatibility with Minipro TL866CS, TL866A, and TL866II+ from
- Autoelectric (http://www.autoelectric.cn/en/tl866_main.html)
- More than 13000 target devices (including AVRs, PICs, various BIOSes
  and EEPROMs)
- ZIF40 socket and ISP support
- Vendor-specific MCU configuration bits
- Chip ID verification
- Overcurrent protection
- System testing
