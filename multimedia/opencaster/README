  - Multiplexing of input multicasted UDP transport stream to output
    multicasted UDP transport stream
  - VOD system based on mpeg2 transport stream over IP or over DVB for
    walled garden network like hotels with coax or ethernet.
  - DVB-SSU update
  - Data casting
  - IP encapsualtor
  - PSI/SI generator
  - EPG generator

OpenCaster output has been successfully integrated with a long list
of dvb products, among them there are products by Cisco/Scientific
Atlanta, Ericsson/Tandberg, Dektec, Eurotek, Harmonic/Scopus,
