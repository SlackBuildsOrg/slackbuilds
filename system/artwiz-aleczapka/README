This is a set of artwiz fonts that is compatible with
fontconfig/Xft-2.0.

This script can also build the alternate language versions which
contain more Latin-1 glyphs. Download the appropriate tarball
from the artwiz-aleczapka website and set $FONTLANG to "de" or "se".
See the SlackBuild script for more info. All languages should be able
to coexist on the same machine.

After installation you may need to restart X for it to use the new
fonts.
