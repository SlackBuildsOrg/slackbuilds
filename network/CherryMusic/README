CherryMusic is a music streaming server based on CherryPy and jPlayer.
It can be run remotely or on a single computer and is designed to
handle huge music libraries of 3 TB and more; it also works well
with small collections. In contrast to MPD, Icecast and the like,
CherryMusic allows multiple users to log in via HTTP/HTTPS using a web
browser, browse and search the music database, manage playlists and
stream music to the browser.

The CherryMusic server runs on Linux, Windows and OS X, as long as
Python and SQLite are available. To use the web client, any device
with a modern browser will do.

Optional dependencies are:

    Live transcoding: faad2
    For special character search terms: python-unidecode
