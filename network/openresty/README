openresty is a dynamic web platform based on NGINX and LuaJIT.

Install dependence packages
  slackpkg -batch=on -default_answer=y install zlib \
    gd libxslt fontconfig libxcb libX11 libXau libXdmcp libXpm

By default, openresty will use the "nobody" user and group accounts.
You may specify alternate values on the command line if desired;
for example:

  OPENRESTYUSER=backup OPENRESTYGROUP=backup ./openresty.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to
make sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.

Geoip support is now available as an option using the GeopIP
package. If you wish to enable GeoIP the pass GEOIP variable to the
slackbuild:

  GEOIP=yes ./openresty.SlackBuild

Support for gperftools is available as an option using the gperftools
package. If you wish to enable gperftools pass the GPERF variable to
the slackbuild:

  GPERF=yes ./openresty.SlackBuild

Extra modules not included with stock openresty can be added by passing
them as a variable to the slackbuild as a space separated list of
full paths to modules.  List of extra 3rd party modules available at
http://wiki.openresty.org/3rdPartyModules.

  ADDMODULE="/tmp/passenger-release-5.0.13/ext/openresty" \
     ./openresty.SlackBuild

Using the optional dynamic loadable module support in openresty >=
1.10.0. Understand that dynamic modules are a new feature in \
openresty and issues may arise until further testing is done.

  DYNAMIC=yes ./openresty.SlackBuild
