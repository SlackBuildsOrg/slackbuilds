phply is a parser for the PHP programming language written using PLY,
a Lex/YACC-style parser generator toolkit for Python.

See README.Slackware for some usage notes.

A Note on Dependencies:

The python library simplejson is an optional dependency. phply ships
with a script php2json.py in /usr/doc/phply-$VERSION/tools that
requires it.
