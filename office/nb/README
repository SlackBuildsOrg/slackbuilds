nb is an elaborate bash script for note management. It uses external
tools for much of its power.

PS: Although nb doesn't have any dependencies per se, it is recommended
that you install bat, pandoc, ripgrep, tig and w3m. It can also use a
great many other external tools, se https://xwmx.github.io/nb for more
