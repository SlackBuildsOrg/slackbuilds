gf (a GDB frontend)

Lightweight graphical frontend for GDB. The interface is nice and
simple, quite confortable and responsive to use. It has panels for
locals, watch expressions, stack walker, threads, profiling. The
configuration is easy and flexible, you can also configure by
project (using a local .project.gf file).
It uses the "standard" debugger shortcuts (F5, F9, F10, F11).
