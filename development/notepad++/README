Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer")
source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several
languages.
Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by
GNU General Public License.

This Slackbuild is made as an example of how you can run windows
software i686 or x86_64 in Slackware without installing multilib.
It uses a dedicated AppImage bundled with Notepad++.

You can modify the wrapper bash script to fit your needs.
Have a look at the included wrapper.patch and the SlackBuild.
