xfdashboard provides a GNOME shell dashboard and macOS Mission
control (Expos√© and Spaces) like interface for use with the Xfce
desktop. It can be configured to run with any keyboard shortcut and
when executed provides an overview of applications currently open
enabling the user to switch between different applications. The
search feature works like Xfce's app finder which makes it
convenient to search for and start applications.
