Hyrule is a utility library for the Hy programming language.

It can be thought of as the Hy equivalent, or addition, to Python's
standard library. While intended primarily for Hy programs, its
functions and classes can be used in Python as with any other Python
library; just import hyrule. Hyrule's macros, on the other hand, are
only really usable in Hy.
