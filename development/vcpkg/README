vcpkg is a C/C++ dependency management framework used as a build-time
tool by modern projects.

It provides CMake integration, library port definitions, and build
configuration files (triplets) required by software that embeds vcpkg
into its build system.

- command-line tool for managing C/C++ dependencies;
- CMake toolchain file for build integration;
- ports and triplets describing third-party libraries;
- used during build time, not at runtime;
- required by projects such as the Ladybird web browser.
