perl-Mojolicious-Plugin-Humane - Mojolicious integration for humane.js

perl-Mojolicious-Plugin-Humane is a Mojolicious plugin
allowing easy use of humane.js, a browser notification handler
(http://wavded.github.com/humane-js/).

By default the template needed to render the messages is injected only
if needed.

For infrequent use, this is less costly overall and less to think
about.

If messages are to be used frequently or perhaps humane.js is to also
be used without reloading the page (via websockets perhaps) then turn
the auto feature off and add the template to your layout manually.

Internally this plugin uses the (non-localized) stash keys
humane.stash and humane.flash. Other stash keys starting with
humane. are reserved for future use should be avoided.
