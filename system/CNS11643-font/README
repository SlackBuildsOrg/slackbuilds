This package contains two type of fonts: TW-Kai and TW-Sung, which are
provided by CNS11643 Chinese Standard Interchange Code Master Ideographs
from Taiwan.

Included is a config file that adds the Noto Sans CJK family to a higher
spot in the default "sans-serif" substitutes. If you're using a
graphical desktop environment, this would make sure that your default
Chinese font substitute, Noto Sans CJK, wouldn't be superseded by the
fonts installed by this package. If your default fonts are changed after
installing this package, please email me at ltlnx (at) gmx (dot) com.

Another config file is included, 35-CNS11643-font.conf, that
binds the Windows counterparts "MingLiU" (細明體) and "PMingLiU"
(新細明體) to TW-Sung, and "DFKai-SB", "UKai" (標楷體) to TW-Kai.
If you want it copied into /etc/fonts/conf.avail, add the
environment variable "ADDCONF=yes" at the front of the SlackBuild,
and run it as such:

  ADDCONF=yes ./CNS11643-font.SlackBuild

If you're using a SlackBuild manager, the way of adding variables may
differ; please consult the manual of your program for instructions.
