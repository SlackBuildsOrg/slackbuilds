swtpm (TPM emulation)

swtpm emulates a TPM (Trusted Process Module) in software; once
running, QEMU can attach TPMs to virtual machines (to run Windows 11,
for example). See specs/tpm.rst in the QEMU doc directory for more
details.

Please note that the swtpm command will emulate TPM 1.2 unless it is
called with "--tpm2".

For more information about the different tools provided by swtpm, see
the documents in /usr/doc/swtpm-0.9.0/readmes.

The user and group for TSS are both "tss" by default, and should have
been created before compiling the trousers package.

It is not possible to install Windows 11 to a virtual machine without
Secure Boot-enabled UEFI firmware and variables. See edk2-ovmf on SBo.
