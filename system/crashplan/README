CrashPlan is a backup software product that backs up personal files
once a day:

* Free onsite backup, allowing you to back up to other computers and
  attached external hard drives.
* Free offsite backup when you back up to computers belonging to people
  you know, like friends and family.
* Paid cloud-storage backup: the free version of CrashPlan does not
  back up to their cloud storage.

The daemon is CrashPlanEngine, which is started by rc.crashplan.
The GUI can be launched by using the command CrashPlanDesktop.
