pgRouting extends the PostGIS / PostgreSQL geospatial database to
provide geospatial routing functionality.

The following algorithms are compiled:
* All Pairs Shortest Path, Johnson's Algorithm
* All Pairs Shortest Path, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* Shortest Path A*
* Bi-directional Dijkstra Shortest Path
* Bi-directional A* Shortest Path
* Shortest Path Dijkstra
* Driving Distance
* K-Shortest Path, Multiple Alternative Paths
* K-Dijkstra, One to Many Shortest Path
* Traveling Sales Person
* Turn Restriction Shortest Path

To build the pgRouting documentation, pass WITH_DOC=ON to the script
(this requires the Sphinx package to be installed).
