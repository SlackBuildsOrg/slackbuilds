Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize,
cite, and share research.

Zotero is the only software that automatically senses research on
the web. Need an article from JSTOR or a preprint from arXiv.org?
A news story from the New York Times or a book from a library?
Zotero has you covered, everywhere.

Zotero helps you organize your research any way you want. You can
sort items into collections and tag them with keywords. Or create
saved searches that automatically fill with relevant materials as
you work.

Zotero instantly creates references and bibliographies for any
text editor, and directly inside Word, LibreOffice, and Google
Docs. With support for over 100,000 citation styles, you can
format your work to match any style guide or publication.

Zotero can optionally synchronize your data across devices,
keeping your notes, files, and bibliographic records seamlessly
up to date. If you decide to sync, you can also always access
your research from any web browser.

Zotero lets you co-write a paper with a colleague, distribute
course materials to students, or build a collaborative
bibliography. You can share a Zotero library with as many
people you like, at no cost.

Zotero is open source and developed by an independent,
nonprofit organization that has no financial interest in your
private information. With Zotero, you always stay in control
of your own data.
