The resolution of the entities defined in RFC 2307 is generally
performed by a set of UNIX C library calls (such as getpwnam()
to return the attributes of a user). The nss_ldap module provides
the means for Solaris and Linux workstations to get this information
(such as users, hosts, and groups) from LDAP directories. The module
is the reference implementation of RFC 2307, and has been studied by
vendors such as Sun (who developed the original Name Service Switch
interface).
