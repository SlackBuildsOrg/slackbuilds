text2pdf (Converts text files to PDF)

text2pdf makes a 7-bit clean PDF file (version 1.1) from any input
file. It reads from standard input or a named file, and writes the PDF
file to standard output. You can specify the font, number of lines
and columns, paper size and various other options from the command
line. By default, long lines will be wrapped, and a formfeed character
(^L) will cause a page break.
