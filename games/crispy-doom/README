Crispy Doom is a fork of Chocolate Doom that provides a higher
display resolution, removes the static limits of the Doom engine and
offers further optional visual, tactical and physical enhancements
remaining entirely config file, savegame, netplay and demo compatible
with the original.

Only crispy-doom , crispy-heretic and crispy-hexen are built with this
script.  For crispy-strife, please try one of the other DooM ports on
SBo (like chocolate-doom, gzdoom, etc).
