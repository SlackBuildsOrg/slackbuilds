sword-data-kjv is a data package containing the King James bible with
Strongs dictionaries.
This packages the King James Version bible with strongs references
and the strongs Hebrew and Greek dictionaries for use with the sword
engine/library V1.7.0 or higher. This and many other bibles and
dictionaries can be downloaded from the www.crosswire.org web site. As
this is packaging data only, it is platform independant.

Go to www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ to find more texts,
dictionaries, commentaries and other related stuff which can be used
by the sword engine.

wget has problems using the urls directly at
www.crosswire.org/sword/modules allthough a browser such as firefox
works fine. See the .info file for an example of url location when using
wget.

most sword based bible programs, such as bibletime or xiphos
(previously called gnomesword) have a facility to download more content
using their gui.

Please Note: you need at least sword 1.7.0 or higher to read this data.
It has been tested with sword 1.7.0 1.7.5a1 1.8.1 and 1.9.0
