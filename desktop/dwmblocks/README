dwmblocks is a modular status bar for dwm written in C.

The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.
Blocks are added and removed by editing the blocks.h header file.

If a blocks.h is found in the SlackBuild directory it will be copied to
the source directory and used in the build, allowing easy customisation.

This build of dwmblocks (written by torrinfail) only contains basic text
support. An asynchronous version of dwmblocks by UtkarshVerma with
clickability support and other features is available at:
