tokodon (Mastodon client for Plasma and Plasma Mobile)

A modern client for Mastodon and other decentralized servers that
implement its API (such as Pixelfed).

NOTE: This is the latest supported version for Slackware 15.0 unless
libraries/kirigami-addons can be updated, which requires Plasma
Framework in Slackware to be updated to 5.91 or higher.
