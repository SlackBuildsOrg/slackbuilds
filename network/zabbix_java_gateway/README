Zabbix offers advanced monitoring, alerting and visualization
features, including distributed monitoring, auto-discovery,
notifications, etcetera.

zabbix_java_gateway needs to run under its own user/group. This has been
assigned to the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change it
on your system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbix            UID: 228        GID: 228
  group:  zabbix                            GID: 228

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXUSER and ZABBIXGROUP variables when running the build script.

For some important post-build and basic configuration instructions,
see the included README.SLACKWARE file.
