The stopit python module provides the user with a function that raises
an exception in another thread, including the main thread. It also
provides two context managers that may stop its inner block activity
on timeout and two decorators that may stop its decorated callables
on timeout.

This SlackBuild will build with both Python2 and Python 3 support.
