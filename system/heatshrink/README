A data compression/decompression library for embedded/real-time systems.

Key Features:
Low memory usage (as low as 50 bytes) It is useful for some cases with
less than 50 bytes, and useful for many general cases with < 300 bytes.

Incremental, bounded CPU use You can chew on input data in arbitrarily
tiny bites. This is a useful property in hard real-time environments.

Can use either static or dynamic memory allocation The library doesn't
impose any constraints on memory management.

ISC license You can use it freely, even for commercial purposes.
