This is a generic driver for many Epson inkjet printers.
This supports printers using escp protocol variant r2 (escpr2).
If your printer is not listed, try the escpr package instead.

See README.models for supported printer models.

don't forget to restart cups after installing/updating this driver
You will have to print a page in order to get an acurate ink status.

note: for 32bit support use version 1.2.10 as epson ships a 64bit
lib in error for the 32bit build in more recent versions.
