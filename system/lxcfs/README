LXCFS is a simple userspace filesystem designed to work around some
current limitations of the Linux kernel.Specifically, it's providing
two main things.A set of files which can be bind-mounted
over their /proc originals to provide CGroup-aware values.A cgroupfs
like tree which is container aware.The focus is now on making
containers feel more like a real independent system through
the proc masking feature.
