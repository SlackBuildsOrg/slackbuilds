Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X
for Linux and Unix.

NOTE: This builds the stable version of wine. If you need something
more cutting-edge then you may want to check out wine-staging.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES

fontforge:     To build tahoma, tahomabd, and marlett fonts.
webcore-fonts: For MS fonts for the web and Windows Vista.

=======================================================================

NOTES

64bit systems now default to the new WOW64 mode which builds both 64bit
and 32bit PE dlls. This has removed the multilib dependency that was
pereviously required and will allow execution of both 64bit and 32bit
binaries. No multilib required.
