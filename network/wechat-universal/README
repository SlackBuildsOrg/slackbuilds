WeChat is a messaging program developed by Tencent.

This build re-packages a binary deb file of an unofficial
client, written by a company called Universal, producing a
properitary Linux spin-off called Universal OS.

Although the program itself is capable of running as a
simple userspace program, due to privacy privacy concerns,
and also due to pickiness of the program to its environment,
this build installs a bubblewrap (bwrap) wrapper around it,
which works asynchronously.

That is, you need to start and terminate it with separate
commands: /usr/bin/wechat-universal start & and
/usr/bin/wechat-universal stop

One more thing: the system tray icon is dysfunctional, so if
you run the program, and then close the window, it will stay
in the background, but there will be no way to restore the
window. However, this build provides a work-around. If
you run /usr/bin/wechat-universal start & once again after
the program has already been started, it will raise the
program window.

Wechat "magical" screenshot tool is disabled.
