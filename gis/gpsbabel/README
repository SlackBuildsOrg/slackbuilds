GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to
another, whether that format is a common mapping format like Delorme,
Streets and Trips, or even a serial or USB upload or download to a GPS
receiver such as those from Garmin and Magellan. By flattening the
Tower of Babel that the authors of various programs for manipulating
GPS data have imposed upon us, it returns to us the ability to freely
move our own waypoint data between the programs and hardware we choose
to use.

It contains extensive data manipulation abilities making it a
convenient for server-side processing or as the backend for other
tools.

It does not convert, transfer, send, or manipulate maps. We process
data that may (or may not be) placed on a map, such as waypoints,
tracks, and routes.
