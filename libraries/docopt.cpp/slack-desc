# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

docopt.cpp: docopt.cpp (C++11 options parser based on help messages)
docopt.cpp:
docopt.cpp: docopt.cpp generates an option parser based on help
docopt.cpp: messages in man-like style. It eliminates the need to write the
docopt.cpp: repeatable parser code, and instead works off of help messages.
