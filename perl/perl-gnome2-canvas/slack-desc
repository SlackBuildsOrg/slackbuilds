# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-gnome2-canvas: GnomeCanvas widget with Gtk2-Perl.
perl-gnome2-canvas:
perl-gnome2-canvas: Like the Gtk2 module on which it depends, Gnome2::Canvas follows the C
perl-gnome2-canvas: API of libgnomecanvas-2.0  as  closely  as  possible while still being
perl-gnome2-canvas: perlish; the C API  reference  remains  the  canonical  documentation.
