Emscripten is a toolset which allows compiling C/C++ into JavaScript.


If that does not scare you, read further.

Emscripten used to work like a compiler-wrapper around gcc/g++/clang,
and other tools, and doing that now is still possible, via a package
called "emscripten" (not available at SBo). However, since the
ambitions of the authors began to grow, more and more tools were
becoming part of the Emscripten toolset, and it became more and more
unwieldy installing all of them by hand.

This package, emsdk, is a set of "blessed" shell scripts to do just
that in a standardised fashion. It might be compared to an Android
SDK manager, or MinGW installer.

Activate it by sourcing /etc/profile.d/emsdk_env.sh , or run
individual commands by emsdk <command>
