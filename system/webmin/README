Webmin is a web-based interface for system administration for Unix.
Using any modern web browser, you can setup user accounts, Apache,
DNS, file sharing, and much more.  Webmin removes the need to manually
edit Unix configuration files like /etc/passwd and lets you manage
a system from the console or remotely.

Webmin consists of a simple web server and a number of CGI
programs which directly update system files like /etc/inetd.conf and
/etc/passwd. The web server and all CGI programs are written in Perl
version 5, and use only the standard perl modules.

Some modules will require manual configuration from within webmin.
Login with root and root's password.

If you need to start webmin at boot, the recommended way is to add the
following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local script and make sure rc.webmin
has executable permissions set:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.webmin ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.webmin start
  fi

After the webmin service is started, point your web browser to 
http://localhost:10000 and login as root to use webmin.
