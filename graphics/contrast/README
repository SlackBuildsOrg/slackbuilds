Contrast is a simple and modern color contrast checker
developed by the GNOME project.

It allows designers and developers to quickly check if the color
combinations they use meet accessibility standards, such as the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). With an intuitive
interface, users can select foreground and background colors
and instantly see if the contrast ratio is sufficient for
readable and accessible content.

Features:

- Easy-to-use graphical interface
- Real-time contrast ratio calculation
- WCAG compliance checking
- Integration with GNOME desktop environment
