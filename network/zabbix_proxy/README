Zabbix Proxies may greatly simplify maintenance of Zabbix environment
and increase performance of the central Zabbix server.

Also, use of Zabbix Proxies is the easiest way of implementing
centralized and distributed monitoring, when all Agents and Proxies
report to one Zabbix server and all data is collected centrally.

Zabbix offers advanced monitoring, alerting and visualization
features, including distributed monitoring, auto-discovery,
notifications, etcetera.

zabbix_proxy needs to run under its own user/group. This has been
assigned to the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change
it on your system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbix            UID: 228        GID: 228
  group:  zabbix                            GID: 228

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXUSER and ZABBIXGROUP variables when running the build script.

For some important post-build and basic configuration instructions,
see the included README.SLACKWARE file.

This conflicts with zabbix_server package.
