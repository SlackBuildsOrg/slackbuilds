influxdb (An Open-Source Time Series Database)

InfluxDB is an open source time series database with no external
dependencies. It's useful for recording metrics, events, and
performing analytics.

It supports high write loads, large data set storage, and conserves
space thru downsampling, automatically expiring and deleting unwanted
data as well as backup and restore. InfluxDB also makes it easy to
analyze data by providing an easy-to-use SQL-like query language.
