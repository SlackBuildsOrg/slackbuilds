sent (simple plaintext presentation tool)

sent does not need latex, libreoffice or any other fancy file format, it
uses plaintext files to describe the slides and can also display images.
The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window.

If you wish patches:
 Create 'patches' directory and add patches files on it. Declare
 variable PATCHES to yes (PATCHES=yes) before run SlackBuild script.

Optional dependency: farbfeld (include images).
