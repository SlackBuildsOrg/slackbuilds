Lua BitOp is a C extension module for Lua 5.1/5.2 which adds bitwise
operations on numbers.

Features

* Supported functions: bit.tobit, bit.tohex, bit.bnot, bit.band,
  bit.bor, bit.bxor, bit.lshift, bit.rshift, bit.arshift, bit.rol,
  bit.ror, bit.bswap
* Consistent semantics across 16, 32 and 64 bit platforms.
* Supports different lua_Number types: either IEEE 754 doubles, int32_t
  or int64_t.
* Runs on Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Windows and probably anything else you
  can find.
* Simple installation on all systems. No bulky configure scripts.
  Embedded-systems-friendly.
* Internal self-test on startup to detect miscompiles. Includes a
  comprehensive test and benchmark suite.
* Compatible with the built-in bitwise operations in LuaJIT 2.0.
* It's as fast as you can get with the standard Lua/C API.

Optional dependency: lua51. If lua51 is installed at build time, this
package will contain a module for Lua 5.1.
