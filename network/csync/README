Csync is a file synchronizer especially designed for you, the normal
user.

To be more precise csync is a client only bidirectional file
synchronizer. You can use csync for different things. The intention
is to provide Roaming Home Directories for Linux but you can use it to
synchronize your music collection or create a backup of a directory.
