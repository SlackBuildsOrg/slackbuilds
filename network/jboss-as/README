JBoss is a free, open source, Java EE certified platform
for developing and deploying enterprise Java applications, Web
applications, and Portals, JBoss Application Server provides the full
range of Java EE 6 features as well as extended enterprise services

running the SlackBuild script. Examples:

# groupadd -g 254 -r jboss
# useradd -u 254 -M -r -s /bin/bash -d /usr/share/jboss-as \
    -c "JBoss Application Server" -g jboss jboss
