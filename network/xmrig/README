XMRig is a high performance, open source, cross platform RandomX,
KawPow, CryptoNight and GhostRider unified CPU/GPU miner and
RandomX benchmark. Official binaries are available for Windows,
Linux, macOS and FreeBSD.

Mining Backends:
* CPU (x64/ARMv7/ARMv8)
* OpenCL for AMD GPUs
(CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs requires an external CUDA plugin "xmrig-cuda"
as a dependency; for the time being, you will have to compile this
yourself)

Usage:
The preferred way to configure the miner is the JSON config file,
as it is more flexible and human friendly. The command line interface
does not cover all features, such as mining profiles for different
algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without
miner restart by editing the config file or executing API calls.

Config File:
An online wizard (located at https://xmrig.com/wizard) can be used
to help create an initial configuration for the miner. The resulting
config file must be placed as either .xmrig.json or .config/xmrig.json
in your user home directory.

Donations:
Donations are the percentage of your hashing power that you want to
donate to the developer, and are used to support XMRig Development.
Default donation 1% (1 minute in 100 minutes) can be increased via
command line option --donate-level or disabled in the source code.
Alternatively, pass the option "DONATE=no" to the script to disable
donations altogether (although a one-time donation to the developers
is recommended if you choose to do this).

Algorithms:
Various algorithms can be enabled/disabled by passing variables to the
script (VAR=yes/no ./feather.SlackBuild) These algorithms include:
WITH_CN_LITE=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable all CryptoNight-Lite algorithms (cn-lite/*))
WITH_CN_HEAVY=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable all CryptoNight-Heavy algorithms (cn-heavy/*))
WITH_CN_PICO=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable CryptoNight-Pico algorithms (cn-pico and cn-pico/tlo))
WITH_CN_FEMTO=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable CryptoNight-UPX2 algorithm)
WITH_RANDOMX=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable RandomX algorithms (rx/*))
WITH_ARGON2=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable Argon2 algorithms (argon2/*)
WITH_KAWPOW=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable KawPow algorithm (kawpow)
WITH_GHOSTRIDER=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable GhostRider algorithm (gr)

Features:
Various features can be enabled/disabled by passing variables to the
script (VAR=yes/no ./feather.SlackBuild) These features include:
WITH_HWLOC=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable hwloc support. Disabling this feature is not recommended
     in most cases. This feature adds an external dependency to
     libhwloc (1.10.0+))
WITH_LIBCPUID=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable built-in libcpuid support. This feature is always disabled
     if hwloc is enabled. If both hwloc and libcpuid are disabled, auto
     configuration for CPU will be very limited.)
WITH_HTTP=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable built-in HTTP support. This feature is used for HTTP API
     and daemon (solo mining) support)
WITH_TLS=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable SSL/TLS support (secure connections to pool). This feature
     adds an external dependency to OpenSSL (included in Slackware by
     default))
WITH_ASM=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable assembly optimisations for modern CryptoNight algorithms)
WITH_EMBEDDED_CONFIG=yes|no (default: no)
    (enable embedded config support)
WITH_OPENCL=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable OpenCL backend)
WITH_CUDA=yes|no (default: no)
    (enable NVIDIA CUDA backend; requires xmrig-cuda dependency)
WITH_NVML=yes|no (default: no)
    (disable NVML (NVIDIA Management Library) support. This feature is
     only available if CUDA is enabled)
WITH_MSR=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable MSR mod & 1st-gen Ryzen fix)
WITH_ADL=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable ADL (AMD Display Library) or sysfs support. Tihs feature
     is only available if OpenCL is enabled)
WITH_PROFILING=yes|no (default: no)
    (enable profiling for developers)
WITH_SSE4_1=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable SSE 4.1 for Blake2)
WITH_BENCHMARK=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable builtin RandomX benchmark and stress test)
WITH_SECURE_JIT=yes|no (default: no)
    (enable secure access to JIT memory. Off by default on all OS,
     except for macOS with ARM CPU)
WITH_DMI=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable DMI/SMBIOS reader)
