An init script has been provided to run 
electrs as a daemon. To configure electrs, edit:

    /etc/electrs/config.toml

!! Before you run the server, you have to specify the daemon directory !!
			!! And setup permissions !!

Remember to chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs before starting.

In order to use the default configuration you should create a 
'electrs' user and group with the following commands:

    groupadd -g 386 electrs
    useradd -u 386 -g 386 -c "electrs" -d /var/run/electrs -s /bin/false electrs

To start electrs automatically at system start, add the following
to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs start
    fi

To properly stop electrs on system shutdown, add the following
to: /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs stop
    fi
