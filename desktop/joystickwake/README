If installed from a package, joystickwake launches automatically when
a user logs in to any modern linux desktop environment. It can also be
run manually, without formal installation, since the executable is
self-contained.

While running, it monitors udev to find devices with the
ID_INPUT_JOYSTICK property (including devices that are plugged in later)
and reacts to activity from any of them.

The screen is kept awake by periodically running a heartbeat-like wake
command: an external tool provided by the system. Most desktop
environments and screen savers include such a command, and joystickwake
knows how to use the common ones, so there is normally no need for a
user to install or configure one. This design keeps joystickwake
compatible with just about every screensaver and power management system
there is.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES

python3-dbus-fast:
if installed joystickwake will also try to inhibit the desktop
environment's screen idle state for a short while after detecting
activity, using the org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver interface. This helps
with certain environments whose heartbeat-style wake interfaces are
missing or broken.
