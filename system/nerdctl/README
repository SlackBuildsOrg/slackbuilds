The goal of nerdctl is to facilitate experimenting the cutting-edge
features of containerd that are not present in Docker (see below).

Note that competing with Docker is not the goal of nerdctl. Those
cutting-edge features are expected to be eventually available in Docker
as well.

Also, nerdctl might be potentially useful for debugging Kubernetes
clusters, but it is not the primary goal.
