# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-File-Download:
perl-File-Download: This Perl module is largely derived from the lwp-download program
perl-File-Download: that is installed by LWP or the libwww-perl networking package. This
perl-File-Download: module abstracts the functionality found in that perl script into a
perl-File-Download: simpler more developer-friendly interface for downloading large
perl-File-Download: files.
