Ttkbootstrap is a library that gives a supercharged theme extension 
to tkinter, the python theme engine for Tk. 

It allows to create on-demand widgets in modern flat style themes 
inspired by the Web library Bootstrap and useful for quick 
development: the library includes over a dozen pre-built dark and 
light themes whose properties can be applied using simple keywords, 
instead of long and complicated ttk style classes. 
It also includes ttkcreator, a built-in theme creator that enables 
the build of own custom themes.
