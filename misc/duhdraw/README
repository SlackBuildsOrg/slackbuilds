duhdraw (ASCII/ANSI art editor)

DuhDraw, written by Ben Fowler and maintained by Pekka Enberg, is a
Linux based Open Source clone of TheDRAW, an MS-DOS ASCII/ANSI art
editor.

The package includes 3 executables:

duhdraw - the editor. Press Alt-H to see the built-in help screen.
ansi - a viewer for the ASCII/ANSI art files created by duhdraw.
ansitoc - converts an ASCII/ANSI art file to a C char array.

Also there are some example art files in:
  /usr/doc/duhdraw-$VERSION/examples

Optional: misb/cp437. Since most BBS ANSI art files are actually
in MS-DOS codepage 437 encoding, they'll look more correct in UTF-8
terminals if run as e.g.:
  $ cp437 duhdraw filename.ans
