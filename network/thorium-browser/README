Thorium (The fastest browser on Earth)
---------------------------------------

Here's how to install Thorium on Slackware.

1. First, go to the Thorium releases section on github:

https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/releases

2. Click the download button for the desired .deb package:

    < >  thorium-browser_*amd64.deb (for Debian/Ubuntu)

3. Then, with the thorium-browser_122.0.6261.132_amd64.deb
package in the same directory as the thorium-browser.SlackBuild
script, run the script as root to convert the .deb to a Slackware
.txz:

./thorium-browser.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version
of Thorium found in the .deb package, but it will be something
like: thorium-browser-122.0.6261.132-x86_64-1_SBo.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


4. Then, install the package (again as root):

$ PKGNAME=/tmp/thorium-browser-122.0.6261.132-x86_64-1_SBo.txz
$ upgradepkg --install-new $PKGNAME


Enjoy!  :-)
