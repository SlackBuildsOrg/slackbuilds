# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lepton-eda: lepton-eda (Lepton Electronic Design Automation)
lepton-eda:
lepton-eda: Lepton EDA is a suite of free software tools for designing
lepton-eda: electronics. It provides schematic capture, netlisting into
lepton-eda: over 30 netlist formats, and many other features.
lepton-eda: It was forked from the gEDA/gaf suite in late 2016 by most
lepton-eda: of its active developers at that time.
lepton-eda: It's backward compatible with its predecessor and supports
lepton-eda: the same file format for symbols and schematics.
