# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-File-FcntlLock: File locking in Perl is usually done using the flock function.
perl-File-FcntlLock: Unfortunately, this only allows locks on whole files and is often
perl-File-FcntlLock: implemented in terms of the flock system function which has some
perl-File-FcntlLock: shortcomings and slightly different behaviour than fcntl. Using this
perl-File-FcntlLock: module file locking via fcntl(2) can be done
