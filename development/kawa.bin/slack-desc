# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kawa.bin: less boiler-plate, fast and easy start-up, a REPL, no required
kawa.bin: compilation step); with the benefits of traditional compiled langs
kawa.bin: (fast execution, static error detection, modularity, zero-overhead
