ruby_stable will install ruby (latest stable version) to the /opt
directory.

This SlackBuild script is for the latest stable version of Ruby. This
build allows users to install and use the most up-to-date Ruby release
alongside the system-provided version. Importantly, it does not replace
or interfere with the Ruby version supplied by the system. Instead,
it offers a clean way to run the latest Ruby without modifying or
affecting the system's default Ruby environment.

To run this version, you need to have to add the path to the $PATH
environment variable:

export PATH="/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"

------------------

This can be particularly useful for developers who prefer not to use
version managers like rbenv or rvm. Instead of managing multiple Ruby
environments and shims, this approach offers a simpler alternative:
a clean, system-wide installation of the latest Ruby that coexists
with the system version.
