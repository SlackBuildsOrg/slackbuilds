pipes.sh is a small animated pipes screensaver for the terminal.

It draws continuously moving pipes using ANSI escape sequences and
runs entirely as a shell script.

pipes.sh is commonly used as a terminal screensaver, visual demo,
or simply as a fun distraction while a terminal is idle.

This SlackBuild installs the pipes.sh script and its manual page
without requiring any build steps or dependencies.
