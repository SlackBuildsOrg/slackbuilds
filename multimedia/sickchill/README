sickchill (Less rage, more chill.)

Automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows. It watches for new
episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its
magic.

NOTE: Requires sickchill user and group.
 groupadd -g 377 sickchill
 useradd -u 377 -g sickchill -d /var/lib/sickchill -s /bin/false sickchill

If you previously had sickrage installed, please change the user and
group with the following:

 groupmod -n sickchill sickrage
 usermod -l sickchill -g sickchill -d /var/lib/sickchill sickrage 

To have this start up with Slackware, please add the following to your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

# Start sickrage
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sickrage ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sickrage start
fi

If you want it to shut down properly when Slackware restarts or shuts
down, please add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
(it may need to be created):

# Stop sickrage
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.sickrage ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.sickrage stop
fi
