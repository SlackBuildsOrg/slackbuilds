GenPUID is a MusicIP (now known as AmpliFIND Music Services)
proprietary closed source command line utility for performing music
analysis and audio fingerprinting of music files. GenPUID runs under
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

If MusicBrainz Picard can not find a PUID for a file, it may need to
be run through GenPUID to be analyzed first.

Having problems with Unicode filenames?
Instead of using 'genpuid dns-key *' to scan Unicode files, use
'genpuid dns-key -r .' as a workaround.

This only works on x86: there are no x86_64 binaries.
