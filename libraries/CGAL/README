The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) provides
efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++
library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation,
such as computer graphics, scientific visualization, computer aided
design and modelling, geographic information systems, molecular
biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion planning, mesh
generation and numerical methods.
