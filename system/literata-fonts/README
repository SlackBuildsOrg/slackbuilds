Literata

Literata is a serif screen font family â€” an old soul wrapped in the
modern trappings of advanced code. Digital text represents one of the
most important challenges faced by designers and developers today, so
Literata 3 was conceived for intensive editorial use, especially on
screens of all sorts. Its main potential is in digital publishing,
whether on the web, electronic press, or mobile applications.
Originally designed as the custom typeface for all Google Play Books,
it is available for free as a cutting-edge variable font.
