# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Crypt-CBC: perl-Crypt-CBC (perl Cipher Block Chaining Mode cipher)
perl-Crypt-CBC:
perl-Crypt-CBC: This module is a Perl-only implementaiton of the cryptographic cipher
perl-Crypt-CBC: block chaining mode (CBC).  In combination with a block cipher such as
perl-Crypt-CBC: DES or IDEA, you can encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily long
perl-Crypt-CBC: length.  The encrypted messages are compatible with the encryption
perl-Crypt-CBC: format used by the OpenSSL package.
