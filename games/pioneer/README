Pioneer is a space adventure game set in the Milky Way galaxy at the
turn of the 31st century.

The game is open-ended, and you are free to explore the millions of star
systems in the game. You can land on planets, slingshot past gas giants,
and burn yourself to a crisp flying between binary star systems. You can
try your hand at piracy, make your fortune trading between systems, or
do missions for the various factions fighting for power, freedom or
self-determination.

When running a new version of Pioneer, saved games from previous
versions are unplayable, and marked in red on the "Load game" screen.
Users who wish to back up their saves before attempting recovery through
the menu can copy $HOME/.local/share/pioneer (or $HOME/.pioneer, if
applicable) to another location.

To build with debugging support, use:

OpenGL core profile version 3.1 or newer is a runtime dependency. To
determine what version of OpenGL is installed, use:
