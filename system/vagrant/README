Vagrant is a tool for building complete virtualised development
environments.

Vagrant was originally written as a wrapper around VirtualBox, but it
now supports plugins for Amazon EC2, VMware and other virtualisation
software. Vagrant also integrates with provisioning software such as
Chef, Puppet and Ansible.
