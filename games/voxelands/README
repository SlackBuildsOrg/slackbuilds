Voxelands is an infinite-world block sandbox game and a game engine,
forked from minetest, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft and the like.
It is Free and Open Source Software, released under the GPL 3 or
later, available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Voxelands differs
from minetest in that it does not have advanced support for mods,
but instead aims to offer a more immediately playable, efficient and
balanced game.
