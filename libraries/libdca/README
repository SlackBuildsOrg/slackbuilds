libdca - a free DTS Coherent Acoustics decoder (previously libdts)

libdca is a free library for decoding DTS Coherent Acoustics streams.
The code is written by Gildas Bazin and was based on the a52dec
project. The DTS Coherent Acoustics standard is used in a variety of
applications, including DVD, DTS audio CD and radio broadcasting. It
includes libdts. It is released under the terms of the GPL license.

WARNING: libdca is still in early development stage so don't expect too
         much of it.

Provisional Warning: DTS Incorporated claims that use of libdca
software to decode DTS compressed sound data on a DVD could violate
DTS's patent rights. If you are unsure about the legality of using
and distributing this code in your country, in particular in the USA,
please consult your lawyer before downloading it.

NOTE:
dcadec binary is also found in dcadec package.
