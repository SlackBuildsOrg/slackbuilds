par2cmdline 0.4 with Intel Threading Building Blocks

This is a concurrent (multithreaded) version of par2cmdline 0.4,
a utility to create and repair data files using Reed Solomon
coding. par2 parity archives are commonly used on Usenet posting
to allow corrupted postings to be repaired instead of needing the
original poster to repost the corrupted file(s).

Note: if you have installed the par2cmdline package this one will
overwrite the par2 binary file, so do not install both versions.
