SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) is a feature of microprocessors
that has been available for many years. SIMD instructions perform a
single operation on a batch of values at once, and thus provide a way
to significantly accelerate code execution. However, these instructions
differ between microprocessor vendors and compilers.

xsimd provides a unified means for using these features for library
authors. Namely, it enables manipulation of batches of numbers with
the same arithmetic operators as for single values. It also provides
accelerated implementation of common mathematical functions operating
on batches.
