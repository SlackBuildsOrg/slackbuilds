go-fonts -- fonts for the Go programming language. 

These fonts do not depend on installation of Go itself.

From the 'Go fonts' announcement:

The font family, called Go (naturally), includes
proportional- and fixed-width faces in normal, bold, 
and italic renderings. The fonts have been tested for
technical uses, particularly programming. Go source 
code looks particularly good when displayed in Go 
fonts, as its name implies, with things like punctuation
characters easily distinguishable and operators lined up
and placed consistently.
