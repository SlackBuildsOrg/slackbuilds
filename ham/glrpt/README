glrpt can decode images in real time as they are received from the
satellite and display them incrementally as they form,
slow-scan TV fashion.
The images displayed in the glrpt window are scaled down by a factor
specified in the ~/glrpt/glrptrc configuration file.
The APID channel images stored in ~/glrpt/images/ are full sized and
are saved either in the PGM (Portable Grey Map) format or JPEG format.
A new JPEG compression code in glrpt allows both monochrome and color
images to be saved as good quality jpeg files.
Please note that the images/ directory can be a relative link to some
other directory of user's choice.
