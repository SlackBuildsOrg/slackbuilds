# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ospray_studio: Intel OSPRay Studio is an open source and interactive visualization
ospray_studio: and ray tracing application that leverages Intel OSPRay as its core
ospray_studio: rendering engine. It can be used to load complex scenes requiring
ospray_studio: high fidelity rendering or very large scenes requiring
ospray_studio: supercomputing resources. The main control structure is a scene graph
ospray_studio: which allows users to create an abstract scene in a directed
ospray_studio: acyclical graph manner. Scenes can either be imported or created
ospray_studio: using scene graph nodes and structure support.
