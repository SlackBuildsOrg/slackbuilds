Rclone is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage.
It is a feature-rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including
S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well
as standard transfer protocols.

Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync,
cp, mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and --dry-run protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its API.
