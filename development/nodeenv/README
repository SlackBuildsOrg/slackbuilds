Node.js virtual environment
===========================

``nodeenv`` (node.js virtual environment) is a tool to create isolated
node.js environments.

It creates an environment that has its own installation directories,
that doesn't share libraries with other node.js virtual environments.

Also the new environment can be integrated with the environment which
was built by virtualenv_ (python).
