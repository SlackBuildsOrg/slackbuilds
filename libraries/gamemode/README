gamemode (Optimise Linux system performance on demand)

GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request
a set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS and/or
a game process.

GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems
with the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is
now host to a range of optimisation features and configurations.

GameMode is automatically activated on the games/apps below. For
others, you will need to request GameMode when running the game. That
can be done by launching the game through gamemoderun:

  gamemoderun $location/$to/$game

Or edit the Steam launch options:

  gamemoderun %command%

The daemon is configured with a gamemode.ini file. A default file is
installed in /usr/share/gamemode/gamemode.ini. This file may get
overwritten when the package is updated, so it is recommended to save
changes in /etc/.

Configuration files are loaded and merged from the following
directories, from highest to lowest priority:

  1. $PWD ("unsafe" - [gpu] settings take no effect in this file)
  2. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/ ("unsafe" - [gpu] settings take
     no effect in this file)
  3. /etc/
  4. /usr/share/gamemode/ (provided by package - may be overwritten on
     future updates... store changes elsewhere)

The following games are known to integrate GameMode support (meaning
they don't require any additional configuration to activate GameMode
while running):

  -DiRT 4
  -Rise of the Tomb Raider
  -Shadow of the Tomb Raider
  -Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia
  -Total War: ROME REMASTERED
  -Total War: Three Kingdoms
  -Total War: WARHAMMER II
  -Total War: WARHAMMER III

Other apps which can integrate with GameMode include:

  -ATLauncher Minecraft launcher
  -PolyMC Minecraft launcher
  -GNOME Shell (via extension) - indicates when GameMode is active in
   the top panel.
  -Lutris - Enables GameMode for all games by default if available
   (must have both 32- and 64-bit GameMode libraries installed),
   configurable in preferences.
  -RetroArch - is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media
   players.
