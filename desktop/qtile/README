Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager (X11 or
Wayland) written and configured in Python. Qtile is simple, small, and
extensible - it is easy to write your own layouts, widgets and built-in
commands.

You will need to build python3-cairocffi with its optional
python3-xcffib dependency.

python3-dbus-next is an optional dependency for qtile.
It sends notifications through dbus - please additionally install a
notification daemon such as dunst for displaying notifications on qtile.

python3-pywlroots (another optional dependency) provides experimental
Wayland support. If python3-pywlroots is installed, then this SlackBuild
will also install a Wayland .desktop session file.
