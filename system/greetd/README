greetd (A login manager daemon)

greetd is a minimal and flexible login manager daemon that makes no
assumptions about what you want to launch.

Prior to installation you must create a user/group for 'greetd' on
your system:

'groupadd -g 381 greeter'
'useradd -d /var/lib/greeter -u 381 -g greeter -G video -s /bin/false \
greeter'

To start 'greetd' at boot, ensure you've set runlevel 4 and copy the
included '/etc/rc.d/rc.4.greetd' to '/etc/rc.d/rc.4.local' (or add the
contents to your existing file) and reboot.

The default greeter is 'agreety' which is included. This is a text-based
greeter login that resembles a console login. You can change greetd to
load any program upon boot by editing the '/etc/greetd/config.toml'
file. In order to save any changes during an upgrade, it is recommended
to copy the file to '/etc/greetd/greetd.conf' to save your personalized
settings.

*NOTE* You will see an error about "unable to set working directory",
which appears to happen on all non-systemd distros, but doesn't
effect overall use.

There are many additional greeters for greetd, which have yet to be
submitted to SBo, if you have a favorite, please upload a SlackBuild!
