Neatvi is a simple and clean vi(1) implementation, despite its small
size it supports UTF-8, syntax highlighting, multiple windows,
keymaps and right-to-left languages, such as Arabic/Persian. A man
page is not included, but the editor follow classic vi(1) closely,
non-standard extensions are documented in /usr/doc/neatvi-*/README

Tip: If you prefer neatvi as your default vi editor, you can simply
make a link: ln -sf /usr/bin/neatvi /usr/bin/vi
