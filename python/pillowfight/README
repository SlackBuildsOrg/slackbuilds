Pillow is a replacement for PIL that works as a drop-in replacement.
Unlike PIL, it's actively maintained and easy to install. It's pretty
great. There's only one problem, which is that users must first
uninstall PIL before installing Pillow, as they share a namespace.

This makes it very hard for Python modules or products that need to
run on a variety of configurations to easily depend on either PIL
or Pillow without inevitably breaking something (perhaps in subtle
ways). That makes it hard to safely transition.

This package aims to "solve" that by providing a single dependency
that can intelligently depend on either PIL or Pillow, based on what's
already on the system. Packages that still need to work if PIL is
installed, but aim to transition to Pillow, can simply depend on the
pillowfight package.
