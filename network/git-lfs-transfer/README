git-lfs-transfer

git-lfs-transfer provides an experimental server-side
implementation of the proposed Git LFS pure SSH-based
protocol. This utility is intended to be invoked over SSH to
transfer data from one repository to another. The Git LFS
documentation outlines the protocol.

That is, if you want to use git-lfs for tracking large
files, but without an http server, git would normally only
be able to clone and push within one machine.

This binary extends the support of "naive LFS" for multiple
machines connected over ssh. It needs to be installed on a
machine deemed "remote", that is the one you are pushing TO,
or pulling FROM. The machine ON which git-lfs checkouts
large files does not need to have this binary.

The program nees no configuration, git automatically invokes
it if finds.
