xtetris (tetris game for X)

XTetris is a clone of Tetris for the X Window System. Its development
dates back to 1989. This version is from 1995.

This game was in the xgames package in Slackware versions up to 3.2.
It was removed before the 3.3 release (on July 7, 1997).

If you can't hear the sound in the game, that's not a bug: There isn't
any sound.

The code has been patched slightly, to fix a few minor bugs. Also, the
-color option is now enabled by default. If you really want to play in
monochrome, use the -bw option.

Note to tiling window manager users: this needs to run at its original
window size, and can't tolerate being resized while running.
