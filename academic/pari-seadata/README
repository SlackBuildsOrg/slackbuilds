Needed by ellap and ellcard for large primes.
Require PARI/GP 2.4.3 and up.
These polynomials were extracted from the ECHIDNA databases and computed
by David R. Kohel. This covers finite fields of cardinality q up to 750
bits. PARI/GP 2.9 contains fallback code to go on when all modular
polynomials in the database have been exhausted and can handle larger
fields (with an important slowdown).
