.SH NAME
tnfs-fuse \- trivial network filesystem client
.\" RST source for tnfs-fuse(1) man page. Convert with:
.
.\" rst2man.py tnfs-fuse.rst > tnfs-fuse.1
.
.\" rst2man.py comes from the SBo development/docutils package.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
tnfs\-fuse \fBdirectory\fP \fB\-o address=host\fP[:\fIport\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
TNFS is a simplified Internet file transfer protocol, designed for
simplicity and ease of implementation on small systems, such as 8\-bit
computers. It\(aqs simpler than NFS, SMB, or FTP. It\(aqs similar to TFTP,
but has features TFTP lacks.
.sp
\fBtnfs\-fuse\fP is a client for the TNFS protocol.
.sp
Note that \fBtnfs\-fuse\fP uses TCP to communicate with the TNFS server.
Most TNFS clients are written for smaller systems (e.g. Atari or
Spectrum 8\-bit computers) and use UDP. This isn\(aqt an actual problem,
but it\(aqs a factor to take into account when e.g. setting up firewall
rules to allow TNFS traffic. Also, when troubleshooting a failed
TNFS connection from an 8\-bit client, just because you can connect
with \fBtnfs\-fuse\fP using TCP, doesn\(aqt mean the UDP port is open and
working.
.sp
When working with mounted TNFS directories, some error messages will
be wrong, e.g. instead of "Permission denied", you may get "Bad file
descriptor".
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-o address=host\fP[:\fIport\fP]
The hostname or IP address of the TNFS server to mount. If \fI:port\fP is
not given, the default TNFS port (16384) is used.
.TP
.B \fB\-o ro\fP
Mount read\-only.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBtnfs\-fuse\fP supports the full set of \fBfuse\fP options. See
\fBfuse\fP(8) or \fBtnfs\-fuse \-\-help\fP for the list.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
To mount the TNFS server at \fBfujinet.online\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mkdir fujinet
tnfs\-fuse fujinet \-o address=fujinet.online
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now the contents of the TNFS server are visible under fujinet/ (or
whatever name you chose). You might also want to add \fB\-o ro\fP to mount
read\-only.
