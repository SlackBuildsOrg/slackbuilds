From its early beginnings, Xastir
has evolved into a very robust client with a rich feature set
that rivals other APRS clients.

Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)
(also known as "Automatic Position Reporting System") is an
amateur radio based digital communication system for real-time
exchange of digital information to users on the network. APRS
was originally developed by Bob Bruninga, WB4APR more than 20
years ago. It has since evolved into a robust system of interconnected
networks. Xastir is a computer application that provides client
access to this network using the APRS protocol.
