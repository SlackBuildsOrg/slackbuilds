GEOS (Geometry Engine - Open Source) is a C++ port of the Java Topology
Suite (JTS).  As such, it aims to contain the complete functionality
of JTS in C++.  This includes all the OpenGIS "Simple Features for SQL"
spatial predicate functions and spatial operators, as well as specific
JTS enhanced topology functions.

By default, the script does not build nor run the tests. You can use the
option TESTBUILD=YES to build and run the tests before the make install
part.
