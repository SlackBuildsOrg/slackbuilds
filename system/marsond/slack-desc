# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

marsond: marsond (fix Shift/Enter key for Marson/USBLink PS/2=>USB adaptor)
marsond:
marsond: marsond is a daemon for Linux that fixes an issue with a particular
marsond: model of PS/2 => USB keyboard adaptor, the MT606-1 (aka "Marson
marsond: Keyboard and Mouse Link", aka USBLink). The symptoms: in games and
marsond: emulators, the Enter key only works sometimes, and pressing Shift
marsond: and Enter simultaneously makes the Shift key "stick".
