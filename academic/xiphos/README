xiphos (formerly gnomesword. A bible study application)
Xiphos is a bible study program for GNOME. Xiphos is based on the
Sword project by the CrossWire Bible Society.

computer reading of the text using festival has not been tested. if
it works let me know, and i'll remove these two lines from the readme.

note: yelp needs to be built with the same version of webkit2gtk
that xiphos is built with. it will build with 4.0 if desired,
although webkit2gtk4.1 is prefered.
