lazarus (rapid application development tool for freepascal)

Lazarus is a Rapid Application Development Tool for FreePascal. It
comes with the LCL - Lazarus Component Library, which contains platform
independent visual components like buttons, windows, checkbox, treeview
and many, many more. The LCL is platform independent, so you can write
an application once and then compile for various platforms without
changing code.

By default this script builds lazarus with "gtk2" but it can instead
use "qt5" by following these steps:

1. build and install libqtpas from SlackBuilds.org
2. build lazarus with the command:

      LCL=qt5 ./lazarus.SlackBuild

3. install lazarus
