PLplot is a cross-platform software package for creating scientific
plots whose (UTF-8) plot symbols and text are limited in practice only
by what Unicode-aware system fonts are installed on a user's computer.

PLplot will automatically detect supported programming language
environments and build corresponding bindings. For supported
languages, please visit homepage.
