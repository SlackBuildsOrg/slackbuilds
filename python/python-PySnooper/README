PySnooper is a poor man's debugger for Python.

PySnooper lets you inspect variables and see which lines are
running without the need for a debugger, breakpoints or print
statements. To use PySnooper, add one decorator line to the function
you're interested in. You'll get a play-by-play log of your function,
including which lines ran and when, and exactly when local variables
were changed.
