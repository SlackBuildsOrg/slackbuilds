# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rmw: ReMove to Waste is a cross-platform command-line "trash can"
rmw: utility. It can send files to your "Desktop" trash, or a completely
rmw: separate folder; restore files and append a unique string to the
rmw: filenames so they won't be overwritten (duplication protection).
