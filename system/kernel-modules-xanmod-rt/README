This is the modules package you need for kernel-generic-xanmod-rt

Note: The current proprietary NVIDIA, VirtualBox,
VMware Workstation / Player and some other
dkms modules builds do not officially support THIS RT kernel

For building VirtualBox with generic or huge:
Make sure you specify you're other kernel when building
the virtualbox-kernel like
KERNEL=5.15.80 ./virtualbox-kernel.SlackBuild

If you get errors like on this kernel:

failed to execute '/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh'
'/usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh 189 0 09 vboxusers'
: No such file or directory

You probably have a udev configuration from vbox in initrd
when it loads usb drivers and you don't need to worry about it.

If you want to fix this you could run commands similar to these:

mv /lib/udev/rules.d/10-virtualbox.rules /root
/etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload
mkinitrd ## YOURE OPTIONS ##
mv /root/10-virtualbox.rules /lib/udev/rules.d
/etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload
lilo

# /etc/rc.d/rc.local
# Avoid virtualbox startup service for xanmod1

if echo $(uname -a) | grep xanmod1 > /dev/null; then
    chmod -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vbox*
else
    chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.vbox*
fi

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv start
fi

sbopkg might suggest updates for modules not supported by xanmod-rt
They wont be selected by default and you can just ignore those.

Don't use NVIDIA's drivers with this kernel, nouveau works great
for just desktop applications and you get the nice frame buffer, if you
have nvidia give up gaming new games with this kernel.
