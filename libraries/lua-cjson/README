lua-cjson (JSON support for Lua)

The Lua CJSON module provides JSON support for Lua.

Features:
 * Fast, standards compliant encoding/parsing routines
 * Full support for JSON with UTF-8, including decoding surrogate
   pairs
 * Optional run-time support for common exceptions to the JSON
   specification (infinity, NaN,..)
 * No dependencies on other libraries

Caveats:
 * UTF-16 and UTF-32 are not supported

This build will also build a lua51 module, if lua51 is installed,
but the default lua is lua 5.4.
