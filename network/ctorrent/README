CTorrent is a BitTorrent client implemented in C++ to be lightweight
and quick. The original has fallen a little behind in updates and bug
fixes though.

The files here contain the good work of those who wrote the original
CTorrent base code and a number of patches that provide fixes and
enhancements, as well as additional fixes and enhancements.

The purpose of the Enhanced CTorrent effort is to fix problems that
remain in the code, modernize existing features and algorithms, and
implement new features while maintaining low overhead requirements
and a high standard of performance (both part of the original CTorrent
design philosophy).  Highlights of the enhanced client include:

* Support for large files (>2GB) and large torrents (>255 files)
* Strategic selection of pieces to request for download
* Continuous queueing of download requests, tuned based on latency and
  throughput for each peer
* Improved download performance, including parallel requests in initial
  and endgame modes
* Improved bandwidth regulation
* Improved compatibility with other peers
* Performance optimization and bug fixes
* An interface for monitoring and managing multiple clients
* Dynamic cache allocation and management, including prefetch
* Flexible console I/O redirection
* Interactive control commands and menus
