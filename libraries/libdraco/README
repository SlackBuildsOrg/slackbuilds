Draco is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric
meshes and point clouds. It is intended to improve the storage and
transmission of 3D graphics.

Draco was designed and built for compression efficiency and speed. The
code supports compressing points, connectivity information, texture
coordinates, color information, normals, and any other generic
attributes associated with geometry.

Draco is supported as optional dependency by applications that can take
advantage by strong compression of 3D graphics (Blender, qgis, pdal,
for example).
