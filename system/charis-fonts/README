Charis SIL is a Unicode-based font family that supports the wide range
of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It is specially
designed to make long texts pleasant and easy to read, even in less
than ideal reproduction and display environments. This optimized
design provides high readability at low resolutions, but is also clean
and clear on the latest high-resolution devices.

It is an expanded version of Bitstream Charter.
