libmseed (C library framework for manipulating SEED data records)

The miniSEED library provides a framework for manipulation of SEED
data records, a format commonly used for seismological time series
and related data.

The library includes the functionality to read and write data records,
in addition to reconstructing time series from multiple records.

The library should work in Unix-like, Windows and potentially other
environments.
