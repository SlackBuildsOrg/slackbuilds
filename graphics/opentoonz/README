OpenToonz is a 2D animation software published by DWANGO. It is based
on Toonz Studio Ghibli Version, originally developed in Italy by
Digital Video, Inc., and customized by Studio Ghibli over many years
of production.

After installation, a local "stuff" directory on your user area will
be required in order for the program to run. This directory can be
initialised by running the following commands:
  mkdir -p $HOME/.config/OpenToonz
  cp -r /usr/share/opentoonz/stuff $HOME/.config/OpenToonz/
