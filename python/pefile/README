pefile is a Python Portable Executable (PE) reader module.

pefile is a multi-platform Python module to read and work with
Portable Executable (aka PE) files. Most of the information in the
PE Header is accessible, as well as all the sections, section's
information and data.

pefile requires some basic understanding of the layout of a PE
file. Armed with it it's possible to explore nearly every single
feature of the file. Some of the tasks that pefile makes possible
are:

    Modifying and writing back to the PE image
    Header Inspection
    Sections analysis
    Retrieving data
    Warnings for suspicious and malformed values
    Packer detection with PEiD's signatures
    PEiD signature generation
