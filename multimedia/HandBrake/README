HandBrake is a DVD ripping application that reads DVDs and outputs
to a variety of video and audio formats, with options for subtitles,
alternate data streams, presets, and control over advanced options
like bitrate, pixel aspect ratio, deinterlacing, and so on.

The legality of ripping content from commercial DVDs varies from
nation to nation.

By default, HandBrake statically compiles many major encoders and
decoders into the HandBrake binary. It will not use your local ffmpeg,
for instance.

To skip building the GTK GUI, pass GUI=no to the script:

    # GUI=no sh ./HandBrake.SlackBuild


Commands
--------

* The command to launch the HandBrake GUI is `ghb`
* Without the GUI, it's `HandBrakeCLI`
