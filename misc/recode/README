The recode program recognizes or produces approximately 150 character
sets and can convert almost any character set to almost any other.
When exact translations are not possible, the program may get rid of
offending characters or use approximations. Particular attention has
been paid to the proper representation of French language diacritics.

Although we normally wouldn't put anything beta on SlackBuilds,
this release fixes some long-standing bugs that everyone else has
been patching for years.
