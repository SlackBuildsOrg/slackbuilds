This repository provides a library and a simple CLI utility to
automatically configure GNU/Linux containers leveraging NVIDIA
hardware.  The implementation relies on kernel primitives and is
designed to be agnostic of the container runtime.

Provides the `nvidia-container-cli` utility
Does not require CUDA, only the nvidia driver.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
