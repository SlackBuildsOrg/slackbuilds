s-tui is a terminal-based user interface for monitoring system
resources like CPU temperature, frequency, utilization, and power.
It also provides a stress-testing feature to put your system under
load and monitor its behavior in real time. Designed to be simple
and lightweight, it works entirely in the terminal, making it ideal
for remote servers and headless systems.

Optional Dependency: 
- stress or stress-ng (Required to enable stress-testing feature.)
