XFile is a compact file manager for UNIX and alike systems running
X11. It presents the file system as-is, without imaginary locations,
trashcans etc.

By default, Xft fonts will be used by copying a bundled resource
file to enable that into app-defaults. If you wish to use Helvetica
invoked by XLFD strings, pass DEFAULT_XFT=no variable to the script
or override the settings in your X11 resource files.
