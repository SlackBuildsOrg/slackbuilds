This program repairs broken AVI file streams by rebuilding the index
part of the file. This is very useful when trying to preview movies
which have no index part, like files that are partially downloaded
from ed2k (eMule) or bittorent networks. DivFix++ is specially
designed for previewing video download files from P2P networks before
they have finished downloading.

Note that wxGTK3 could be used as a dependency instead of wxPython.
