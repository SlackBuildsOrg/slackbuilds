osm2pgsql is a utility program that converts OpenStreetMap data to
PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL databases. 

Potrace is an optional dependency autodetected.

Required dependencies autodetected are libosmium, protozero, and fmt.
If not found in the system, the build will use the bundled versions
included in the source.

Since version 1.10.0 osm2pgsql needs a 64 bit architecture. For 32 bit
architectures you have to install osm2pgsql-legacy.
