This package contains two type of fonts: TW-Kai and TW-Sung, which are
provided by CNS11643 Chinese Standard Interchange Code Master Ideographs
from Taiwan.

Two config files are available in this SlackBuild package: one is a
config file that adds the Noto Sans CJK family to a higher spot in
"sans-serif" substitutes for supported languages (Chinese, Japanese,
Korean). You would want to enable this if you're using a desktop
environment that has Noto Sans CJK as the default fallback, otherwise
the fallback font would be replaced.

To enable this config, add the environment variable "NOTOPATCH=yes" in
front of the SlackBuild command, and run it as such:

  NOTOPATCH=yes ./CNS11643-font.SlackBuild

If you're using a SlackBuild manager, the way of adding variables may
differ; please consult the manual of your program for instructions.

Another config file is included, 35-CNS11643-font.conf, that
binds the Windows counterparts "MingLiU" (細明體) and "PMingLiU"
(新細明體) to TW-Sung, and "DFKai-SB", "UKai" (標楷體) to TW-Kai.
If you want it copied into /etc/fonts/conf.avail, add the
environment variable "ADDCONF=yes" in front of the SlackBuild.

Therefore I recommend running the SlackBuild like this:

  ADDCONF=yes NOTOPATCH=yes ./CNS11643-font.SlackBuild
