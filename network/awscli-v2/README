The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to 
manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and 
configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command
line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved 
installers, new configuration options such as AWS IAM Identity 
Center (successor to AWS SSO), and various interactive features. 

Note: AWS CLI v2 builds on AWS CLI v1 and includes a number of
features and enhancements based on community feedback.
