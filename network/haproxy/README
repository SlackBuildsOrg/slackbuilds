HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable solution offering high
availability, load balancing, and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based
applications. It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites.

Note that a default configuration file is no longer provided at
/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg. See /usr/doc/haproxy-*/examples 
for some sample configuration files. The directory also contains 
example files for logging.

lua53 is an optional dependency for HAProxy. 
Pass LUA=yes to this script to enable lua support.

This HAProxy package is compiled with Perl Compatible 
Regular Expressions (PCRE) version 2 by default. 
If you want to use PCRE version 1, pass OLDPCRE=yes to this script.
