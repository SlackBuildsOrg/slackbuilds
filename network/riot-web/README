riot-web (Riot.im for web)

Riot (formerly known as Vector) is a Matrix web client built using the
Matrix protocol.

Riot gathers all your conversations and app integrations (e.g. GitHub,
Slack) into one single app.

Built around group chatrooms, Riot lets you share messages, images,
videos and files - interact with your tools and access all your
different communities under one roof.

Another great feature of Riot/Matrix is the federated or decentralised
structure.  Everyone can set up a Matrix server to serve rooms and
users can communicate with other users on other Matrix servers around
the World.

Now with end-to-end encryption using the Olm and Megolm cryptographic
ratchets, and ensuring that only explicitly authorized devices can
participate in a conversation.

This is a packaging of the pre-built released version of Riot (on
Github).

Riot-web now is needed to run under a web server(e.g. NGINX). After
building, a start script (in /usr/bin) is set to invoke a simple web
server (a Python built-in module) listening at port 8000, and then
start a web browser to access it at localhost:8000. Feel free to
change these settings.

Type your favourite browser name before running this script, e.g.

   BROWSER=firefox ./riot-web.Slackbuild
