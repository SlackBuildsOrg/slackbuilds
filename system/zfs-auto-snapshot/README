An alternative implementation of the zfs-auto-snapshot service for
Linux that is compatible with zfs-linux and zfs-fuse.

Automatically create, rotate, and destroy periodic ZFS snapshots. This
is the utility that creates the @zfs-auto-snap_frequent,
@zfs-auto-snap_hourly, @zfs-auto-snap_daily, @zfs-auto-snap_weekly,
and @zfs-auto-snap_monthly snapshots if it is installed.
