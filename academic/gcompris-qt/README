GCompris is a high quality educational software suite, including
a large number of activities for children aged 2 to 10. Some of the
activities are game oriented, but nonetheless still educational.

Currently GCompris offers more than 190 activities, and more are
being developed.

This is Qt6-based version of gcompris.

NOTE:
This software runs better on a platform that has OpenGL 2 support.
If you do not have OpenGL 2 support, you have 2 options:
- Add the following parameter "--software-renderer" at the end of
  the last line of the script in /opt/gcompris-qt/bin/gcompris-qt.sh
  This will affect all users, system-wide.
- Replace "renderer=auto" into "renderer=software" in your local config,
  located in ~/.config/gcompris-qt/gcompris-qt.conf
  This will affect current user only.
