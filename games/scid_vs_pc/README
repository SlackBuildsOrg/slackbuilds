Scid vs. PC is a usability and bug-fix fork of Scid with some
new features.  The project is authored by Stevenaaus, and has been
extensively tested

SCID: Shane's Chess Information Database is a powerful Chess Toolkit,
with which one can create huge chess databases, run engine analysis,
or play casual games against the computer or online with the Free
Internet Chess Server. It was originally written by Shane Hudson, and
has received strong contribution from Pascal Georges and others.

NOTE: As a usability and bug-fix fork of Scid, this package also has
a /usr/bin/scid binary, so after installing scid_vs_pc, the binary
with the same name from the original scid package will be overwritten.
We suggest that one should only use either scid_vs_pc or the original
scid, not both.
