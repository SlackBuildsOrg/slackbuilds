rtcqs (tweak your system for realtime audio)

rtcqs is a Python utility to analyze your system and detect possible
bottlenecks that could have a negative impact on the performance of
your system when working with Linux audio. It is heavily inspired by
raboof's excellent realtimeconfigquickscan script.
