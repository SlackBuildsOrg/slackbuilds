novelWriter is a plain text editor designed for writing novels
assembled from many smaller text documents. It uses a minimal
formatting syntax inspired by Markdown, and adds a meta data syntax
for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing. It's designed to be a
simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text and
notes, using human readable text files as storage for robustness.

The project storage is suitable for version control software, and also
well suited for file synchronisation tools. All text is saved as plain
text files with a meta data header. The core project structure is
stored in a single project XML file. Other meta data is primarily
saved as JSON files.

For more details, and how to install and use novelWriter, please see
