fswatch is a cross-platform file change monitor that receives
notifications when the contents of the specified files or directories
are modified.

The fswatch.SlackBuild automatically builds the linux variant of
fswatch.

If you would like to compile fswatch for another OS, please check the
README files that will be saved to /usr/doc/fswatch-${VERSION}/

The default compiler is clang++; however, if you prefer, fswatch can
also be compiled with g++:

   CXX="g++" ./fswatch.SlackBuild
