python3-typeguard (Run-time type checker for Python)

This library provides run-time type checking for functions defined
with PEP 484 argument (and return) type annotations, and any arbitrary
objects. It can be used together with static type checkers as an
additional layer of type safety, to catch type violations that could
only be detected at run time.
