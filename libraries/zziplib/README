The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the
ability to easily extract data from files archived in a single zip
file. Applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and
access them. The implementation is based only on the (free) subset
of compression with the zlib algorithm which is actually used by the
zip/unzip tools.
