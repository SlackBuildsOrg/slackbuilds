beautysh (beautifier for bash scripts)

beautysh takes upon itself the hard task of beautifying Bash scripts
(yeesh). Processing Bash scripts is not trivial, they aren't like C or
Java programs - they have a lot of ambiguous syntax, and (shudder) you
can use keywords as variables. This means there will be some border
cases beautysh won't be able to process.
