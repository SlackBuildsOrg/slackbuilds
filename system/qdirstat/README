QDirStat is a graphical application to show where your disk space has
gone and to help you to clean it up.

This is a Qt-only port of the old Qt3/KDE3-based KDirStat,
now based on the latest Qt 5. It does not need any KDE libs or
infrastructure. It runs on every X11-based desktop on Linux, BSD and
other Unix-like systems.

QDirStat has a number of new features compared to KDirStat. To name
a few:

 * Multi-selection in both the tree and the treemap.
 * Unlimited number of user-defined cleanup actions.
 * Properly show errors of cleanup actions (and their output, if
   desired).
 * File categories (MIME types) and their treemap color are now
   configurable.
 * Exclude rules for directories are easily configurable.
 * Desktop-agnostic; no longer relies on KDE or any other specific
   desktop.
