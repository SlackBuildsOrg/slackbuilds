python3-levenshtein (Compute string edit distances and similarities)

The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for
fast computation of Levenshtein distance and string similarity.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 0.17.0 due to requiring a
newer Cython than included in Slackware (needs 3.0.2).
