vmd (Terminal Markdown Viewer)

Render markdown in a terminal! Why? Because although Markdown is still
readable as-is, if you use Markdown a lot, it's nice to have something
to render it with the proper formatting - with bold text and emphasis,
etc.

This version is patched to ignore img tags, which makes vmd fail to
parse certain markdown documents.
