Ascii Sector is a fun Wing Commander: Privateer clone, where you travel
the galaxy and build up your fortunes a merchant/pirate. It uses a
colorful roguelike SDL interface.

Have fun!

To run this game the user has to be in the "games" group. Alternatively,

PS: This game seems to be abandoned by its author; This package installs
the last working binary version from an Amazon AWS server.
