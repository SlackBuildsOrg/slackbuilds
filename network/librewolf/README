This project is a custom and independent version of Firefox, with the
primary goals of privacy, security and user freedom.

LibreWolf is designed to increase protection against tracking and
fingerprinting techniques, while also including a few security
improvements. This is achieved through our privacy and security oriented
settings and patches. LibreWolf also aims to remove all the telemetry,
data collection and annoyances, as well as disabling anti-freedom
features like DRM.
