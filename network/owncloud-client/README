The ownCloud Sync Client is a desktop program you install on your
computer. You specify one or more directories on the local machine
to sync with your ownCloud server, and always have your latest files
wherever you are. Make a change to the files on one computer, it will
flow across the others using the desktop sync clients.

This package optionally requires the Sphinx package in order to create
its man pages.
