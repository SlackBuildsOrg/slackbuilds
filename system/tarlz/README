tarlz (parallel implementation of tar and lzip)

tarlz is a massively parallel (multi-threaded) combined implementation
of the tar archiver and the lzip compressor.

tarlz creates tar archives using a simplified and safer variant of
the POSIX pax format compressed in lzip format, keeping the alignment
between tar members and lzip members. The resulting multimember tar.lz
archive is fully backward compatible with standard tar tools like GNU
tar, which treat it like any other tar.lz archive. tarlz can append
files to the end of such compressed archives.

If you'd like to run the tarlz self-test, pass CHECK=yes in the
script's environment. If the self-test fails, the build will abort.
If it passes, the results will be included in the package doc
directory (/usr/doc/tarlz-*) as "make_check.txt".
