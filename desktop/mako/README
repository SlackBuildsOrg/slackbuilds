mako (A lightweight notification daemon for Wayland)

mako implements the FreeDesktop Notifications Specification.

mako will run automatically when a notification is emitted. This happens
via D-Bus activation, so you don't really need to explicitly start it up
(this also allows delaying its startup time and speed up system
startup).
