ScanTailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages. It
performs operations such as:
  * page splitting,
  * deskewing,
  * adding/removing borders,
  * selecting content
  * ... and others.
You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be printed or
assembled into a PDF or DjVu file. Scanning, optical character
recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of
this project.

The ScanTailor version that merges the features of the ScanTailor
Featured and ScanTailor Enhanced versions, brings new ones and fixes.

qt6 is an optional dependency and will be autodetected if it is present
at build time. Otherwise, qt5 will be used.

When using the qt6 version on a low-resolution monitor, the following
settings can be needed

export QT_ENABLE_HIGHDPI_SCALING=0

in, for example, /etc/profile.d/qt6_disable_high-dpi_scaling.sh
