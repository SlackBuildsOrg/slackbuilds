# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

spf-engine: spf-engine (SPF back-end)
spf-engine:
spf-engine: spf-engine provides the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) back-end for
spf-engine: both pypolicyd-spf (for which it was originally developed) and an
spf-engine: future SPF milter using pymilter. The goal is to provide a common
spf-engine: back-end for common features for support SPF integration with Postfix
spf-engine: and Sendmail using both the Postfix policy service and the Sendmail
spf-engine: milter protocol (also available with Postfix).
