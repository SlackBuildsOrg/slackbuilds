rxvt (terminal emulator)

rxvt is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as an xterm
replacement for users who do not require features such as Tektronix
4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As a result, rxvt
uses much less memory -- a significant advantage on a machine serving
many X sessions. Also included is rclock, an analog clock for X.

rxvt was in Slackware up through 14.2; it was replaced with
rxvt-unicode in 15.0. Some people still prefer the original rxvt, so
here it is. Be aware that it's no longer maintained upstream. Also,
be aware that rxvt doesn't support Unicode.
