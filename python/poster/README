poster provides a set of classes and functions to faciliate making
HTTP POST (or PUT) requests using the standard multipart/form-data
encoding.

The modules in the Python standard library don't provide a way to
upload large files via HTTP without having to load the entire file
into memory first.

poster provides support for both streaming POST requests as well as
multipart/form-data encoding of string or file parameters.
