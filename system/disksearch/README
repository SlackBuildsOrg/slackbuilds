DiskSearch is a tool for searching for files on all your removable
media disks, DVD's, SD cards or backup tapes. For instance you can
search for songs on your MP3-CD's or for a document on your backup
DVD's. For advanced queries there is a regular expression search
mode. The search is based on a simple database file needs to be filled
once by adding all your disks to it.
