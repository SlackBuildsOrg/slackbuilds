SSTP-Client (SSTP client for Linux)

SSTP is Microsofts Remote Access Solution (RAS) for PPP over SSL. It
can be used instead of PPTP or L2TP, and is only available with
Windows Vista/7 connecting to a Windows 2008 Server. The advantage of
SSTP compared to PPTP and L2TP is that it cannot be easily blocked
by firewalls since the traffic is transmitted over HTTPS on port
443. Windows Vista/7 uses SSTP if PPTP or L2TP cannot be established.

SSTP-Client is an SSTP client for Linux. It can be used to establish
a SSTP connection to a Windows 2008 Server. This software is similar
commandline and configuration as the pptp-client software.

SSTP-Client features:

  Connect to Microsoft RAS network using SSTP
  Use HTTPS with strong encryption over port 443
  Asynchronous HDLC frame support
  Integration with pon/poff with various distributions
