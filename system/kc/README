kc is a console-based password storing application using an encrypted
XML document as its database.

Features include:
 * fixed string or regex based search
 * OpenSSH agent support for protecting the database
 * YubiKey challenge-response support for protecting the database
 * encrypted or plain text database import/export
 * multiple keychains per database
 * copy passwords to various clipboards
 * editline (libedit) and readline support

This SlackBuild has build options to control some of its behavior:
LIBSCRYPT: If this variable is set, kc will be built with scrypt
      encrypted passwords support. It needs the libscrypt library
      for this, that is also available from SBo.
EDITLINE: If this variable is set, kc will use editline for its
      command line interface; otherwise, readline will be used.
PCRE: If this variable is set, kc will use libcpre to enable
      perl-compatible regular expressions while searching.
      Note that POSIX regular expressions are supported without
      the need of this.
