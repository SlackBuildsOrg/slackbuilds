# 20180917 bkw: libpst supposedly supports python3 now, but python3
# builds fail. Not tried to diagnose it, just reverting to python2,
# like previous versions of libpst used.
# ./configure --help claims that I can set PYTHON_VERSION in the environment
# and it'll use that, but it doesn't work. So I have to use this abomination:
