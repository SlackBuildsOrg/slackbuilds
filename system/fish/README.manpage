fish SlackBuild – manpages
=========================

fish manpage generation depends on Sphinx and Python, which is not
practical to require on Slackware 15.0.

For this reason, manpages are generated once on Slackware-current
and shipped as static data.

1) Manpage tarball
------------------

The file:

  fish-<version>-manpages.tar.gz

contains pre-generated manpages in the following layout:

  man/
    man1/
      *.1

These files are plain text and architecture-independent.

2) How the manpages were generated
----------------------------------

Manpages were generated on Slackware-current from the fish build
directory:

  build/user_doc/man/

The tarball was created from that directory:

  $ cd build/user_doc
  $ tar czf fish-<version>-manpages.tar.gz man

3) Installation during the SlackBuild
-------------------------------------

During the SlackBuild, manpages are installed with:

  tar xf fish-<version>-manpages.tar.gz -C $PKG/usr

They are then compressed using the standard Slackware method.

Any manpages that conflict with coreutils are removed.

4) Updating to a new fish version
---------------------------------

When updating fish:

  - Regenerate fish-<version>-manpages.tar.gz on Slackware-current
  - Update checksums in fish.info

The SlackBuild always installs pre-generated manpages and does not
invoke Sphinx.
