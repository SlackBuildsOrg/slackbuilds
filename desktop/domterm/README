DomTerm is a combined terminal emulator and REPL console using web
technlogies - i.e. JavaScript and DOM: Users can type commands which
gets sent to an application, which evaluates the command, and
displays the results, typically in some kind of type-script format.

DomTerm supports several non-trivial deployment methods (because) it
is a web program, after all. This SlackBuild builds the two simplest
ones:

1. A web service called simply "domterm", which can be opened in a
   browser.
2. A Qt5 binary called "qtdomterm", which can be launched as a normal
   GUI terminal.

Many experimental options, such as using libclipboard, webview, and
wry are not supported (yet).
