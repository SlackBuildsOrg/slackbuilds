.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
zmac is a Z\-80 macro cross\-assembler. It has all the features you\(aqd
expect. It assembles the specified input file (with a \(aq.z\(aq extension
if there is no pre\-existing extension and the file as given doesn\(aqt
exist) and produces program output in many different formats. It also
produces a nicely\-formatted listing of the machine code and cycle
counts alongside the source in a ".lst" file.
.sp
To reduce clutter and command line option usage, by default all zmac
output is put into an (auto\-created) zout subdirectory. For file.z
the listing will be in zout/file.lst, the TRS\-80 executable format
in zout/file.cmd and so on. For more friendly usage in make files
and integrated development environments the \-o, \-\-oo, \-\-xo and \-\-xd
options may be used to select specific output file formats and where
they are written.
.sp
Undocumented Z\-80 instructions are supported as well as 8080 and Z\-180
(aka HD64180).
.sp
zmac strives to be a powerful assembler with expressions familiar to C
programmers while providing good backward compatibility with original
assemblers such as Edtasm, MRAS and Macro\-80.
.sp
This man page only documents the command\-line options. The full documentation can be found here:
/usr/doc/zmac\-20221018_0.7/zmac.html
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Space\-separated arguments in the ZMAC_ARGS environment variable are added to the
end of the command line.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B  \-\-help
Display a list of options and a terse description of what the
options do.
.TP
.B  \-\-version
Print zmac version name.
.TP
.B  \-\-mras
MRAS compatibility mode. Any ? in a label will be expanded to
the current module identifier as set by *mod. Operator
precedence and results are changed.
.TP
.BI \-\-od \ dir
Place output files in dir instead of the default "zout"
subdirectory. Creates dir if necessary.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-oo hex,cmd
Output only the the file types by suffix. Multiple \-\-oo
arguments may be used. "\-\-oo lst,cas" is equivalent to "\-\-oo
lst \-\-oo cas". See "Output Formats" for a list of output types
by suffix.
.TP
.B \-\-xo tap,wav
Do not output the file type types listed by suffix.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B  \-\-dri
Enable compatibility with Digital Research (CP/M) assemblers:
Ignores dollar signs in constants and symbols. Silences a
warning when using Z80.LIB. Allows the use of \(aq*\(aq in first
column for comment lines. Accepts $\-MACRO directives.
.TP
.B  \-\-nmnv
Do not interpret Z\-80 or 8080 mnemonics as values in
expressions.
.TP
.B  \-\-rel
Output ".rel" (relocatable object file) format only. Exported
symbols are truncated to length 6.
.TP
.B  \-\-rel7
Output ".rel" (relocatable object file) format only. Exported
symbols are truncated to length 7.
.TP
.B  \-\-zmac
zmac compatibility mode. defl labels are undefined after each
pass. Quotes and double quotes are stripped from macro
arguments before expansion. $ is ignored in identifiers
allowing foo$bar to construct identifiers in macro expansions.
Use \(ga (backquote) instead in normal mode. Labels starting with
"." are temporary and are reset whenever a non\-temporary label
is defined (thus they may be reused). Labels starting with "_"
are local to their file thus avoid multiple definition when
brought in with include.
.TP
.B  \-\-z180
Use Z\-180 timings and extended instructions. Undocumented Z\-80
instructions will generate errors as the Z\-180 (or H64810) does
not support them. Equivalent to .z180 pseudo\-op.
.TP
.B  \-\-dep
Print all files read by include, incbin and import.
.TP
.B  \-\-doc
Print full documentation in HTML format to standard output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Pk=number
Set @@k to the given numeric value before assembly. Up to 10
parameters can be set from 0 though 9. \-Pk is shorthand for
\-Pk=\-1. For example, P4=$123 effectively puts @@4 equ $123 at
the top of the first file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-D\fB symbol
Define symbol to be 1 before assembly.
.TP
.B  \-\-fcal
Always treat an indentifier in the first column as a label.
zmac uses various heuristics in the case of ambiguity when a
label does not have a colon. This option turns heuristics off.
.TP
.B  \-8
Accept 8080 mnemonics preferentially and use 8080 instruction
timings. Equivalent to .8080 pseudo\-op.
.TP
.B  \-b
Don\(aqt generate any machine code output at all.
.TP
.B  \-c
Don\(aqt display cycle counts in the listing.
.TP
.B  \-e
Omit the "error report" section in the listing.
.TP
.B  \-f
List instructions not assembled due to "if" expressions being
false. (Normally these are not shown in the listing.)
.TP
.B  \-g
List only the first line of equivalent hex for a source line.
.TP
.B  \-h
Display a list of options and a terse description of what the
options do. (same as \-\-help)
.TP
.B  \-i
Don\(aqt list files included with include, read or import.
.TP
.BI \-I \ dir
Add dir to the end of the include file search path.
.TP
.B  \-j
Promote relative jumps and DJNZ to absolute equivalents as
needed.
.TP
.B  \-J
Error if an absolute jump could be replaced with a relative
jump.
.TP
.B  \-l
List to standard output.
.TP
.B  \-L
Generate listing no matter what. Overrides any conflicting
options.
.TP
.B  \-m
List macro expansions.
.TP
.B  \-n
Omit line numbers from listing.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o filename.cmd
Output only the named file. Multiple "\-o" options can be used
to name a set of different files.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B  \-p
Use a few linefeeds for page break in listing rather than ^L.
.TP
.B  \-P
Output listing for a printer with headers, multiple symbols per
column, etc.
.TP
.B  \-s
Omit the symbol table from the listing.
.TP
.B  \-t
Only output number of errors instead list of each one.
.TP
.B  \-z
Accept Z\-80 mnemonics preferentially and use Z\-80 instruction
timings. Equivalent to .z80 pseudo\-op.
