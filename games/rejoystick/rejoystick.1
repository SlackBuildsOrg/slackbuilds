.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
rejoystick [\fI\-d\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBrejoystick\fP is a daemon that converts joystick movement and/or
button presses to X keystroke events. This allows the user to use the
joystick with games that don\(aqt have joystick support.
.sp
There are two modes of operation for \fBrejoystick\fP: the GUI configuration
mode, and daemon mode.
.sp
To configure the axes/buttons \fBrejoystick\fP will map to keystrokes,
run \fBrejoystick\fP with no arguments. This will display a GUI which
you can use to set the mappings. When you\(aqre done, exit the program
(close its window). The mappings will be written to \fI~/.rejoystickrc\fP\&.
Although the configuration is graphical, it\(aqs recommended to run it
from a terminal (not a desktop launcher), so you can see its output.
.sp
To run \fBrejoystick\fP as a daemon, run it with the \fB\-d\fP option. It
will fork to the background, monitor the joystick, and generate
keystroke events according to the configuration in \fI~/.rejoystickrc\fP\&.
.sp
To exit \fBrejoystick\fP, use "\fBkillall \-9 rejoystick\fP". If you want to
change the mappings, you\(aqll have to kill the daemon and restart it,
since it won\(aqt re\-read its config file.
