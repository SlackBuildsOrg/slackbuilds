amsynth is an analog modelling (a.k.a virtual analog) software
synthesizer.

It mimics the operation of early analog subtractive synthesizers
with classic oscillator waveforms, envelopes, filter, modulation and
effects.

The aim is to make it easy to create and modify sounds.

Features
--------

 * Dual oscillators (sine / saw / square / noise) with hard sync
 * 12/24 dB/oct resonant filter (lowpass / highpass / bandpass / notch)
 * Mono / poly / legato keyboard modes
 * Dual ADSR envelope generators (filter & amplitude)
 * LFO which can modulate the oscillators, filter, and amplitude
 * Distortion and reverb
 * Hundreds of presets


There are currently several different ways to run amsynth:

 * Stand-alone application using JACK, ALSA or OSS
 * DSSI plug-in
 * LV2 plug-in
 * VST plug-in

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.

Optional dependencies, autodetected at build time:
jack, lash, dssi, pandoc
