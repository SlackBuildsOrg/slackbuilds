ecCodes is a package developed by ECMWF which provides an application
programming interface and a set of tools for decoding and encoding
messages in the following formats:

    WMO FM-92 GRIB edition 1 and edition 2
    WMO FM-94 BUFR edition 3 and edition 4
    WMO GTS abbreviated header (only decoding).

A useful set of command line tools provide quick access to the messages.
C, Fortran 90 and Python interfaces provide access to the main ecCodes
functionality.

ecCodes is an evolution of GRIB-API. It is designed to provide the
user with a simple set of functions to access data from several
formats with a key/value approach.

netcdf is an optional dependency and support will be compiled in if it
is installed.

NOTE: for 32bit platforms, the version is locked to 2.29.0 as 32 bit
support was dropped in version 2.30.0 and above.
