Thinkfan is a simple, lightweight fan control program. Originally
designed specifically for IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads, it now supports any
kind of system via the sysfs hwmon interface (/sys/class/hwmon). It is
designed to eat as little CPU power as possible.

Before using /etc/rc.d/rc.thinkfan, make sure to create and configure a
/etc/thinkfan.conf file or the daemon will not start.
