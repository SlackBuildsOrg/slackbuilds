# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xseticon:
xseticon: Xterm, and likely many other X11 programs, do not set themselves
xseticon: window icons, which window managers typically use to represent that
xseticon: program window in switcher lists, taskbars, and so on. This program
xseticon: can set the X11 window icon for any given window, to that of a given
xseticon: image file.
