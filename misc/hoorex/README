HooRex is a small tool which, after scanning a local copy of the
SlackBuilds.org packages repository, provides pertinent information
about dependency relationships between the packages.

Its main objective is to determine which other packages depend on the
package(s) being queried. It is also able to answer the reverse query
i.e. which other packages does the queried package(s) depend on. In
either case, the output is listed in build order and (using command
line switches) can be filtered and formatted to accomodate a variety
of usage scenarios.

Commandline tab completion is available in bash shells provided
that Slackware's bash-completion package (from Slackware CD "extra"
directory) has been installed at run time. The tab completion for zsh
should just work (thanks to contribution from David O'Shaughnessy).
