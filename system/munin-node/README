munin-node is the client portion of the Munin Monitoring system. It
allows the Munin master to collect statistics for presentation in
RRDTool time-series graphs.

munin-node is a Perl application and requires several Perl modules as
external dependencies:

  Log::Log4perl
  Net::Server
  Module::Build
  HTML::Template

A Java environment is also required, zulu-openjdk8 is the minimum
required, but newer Java environments also work.

Additionally, the following modules are required for some plugins:

  Net::SSLeay (for SSL connections)
  Net::SNMP
  Net::CIDR

If you need IPv6 support, the following modules are required:

  Socket6
  IO::Socket::INET6

Munin requires that user munin exists and belongs to group
munin. Create these before running the SlackBuild script:

groupadd -g 308 munin
useradd -u 308 -g 308 -s /sbin/nologin munin

Once munin-node is installed, configure plugins per the Munin
documentation.
