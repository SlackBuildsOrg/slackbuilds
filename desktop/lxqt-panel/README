lxqt-panel is the panel for the LXQt Desktop environment.

libstatgrab and libsysstat are optional dependencies.
However, libsysstat is not currently packaged at SlackBuilds.org.

libstatgrab provides the CPU Load and Network Monitor plugins.
libsysstat provides the System Stats plugin.

To add support for the CPU Load and Network Monitor plugins, pass
LIBSTATGRAB=yes to the SlackBuild.
To add support for the System Stats plugin, pass
LIBSYSSTAT=yes to the SlackBuild.

For a default panel configuration, copy the example file provided by
LXQt to the user $HOME config:
cp /usr/share/lxqt/panel.conf $HOME/.config/lxqt/
