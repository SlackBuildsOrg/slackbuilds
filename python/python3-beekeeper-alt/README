python3-beekeeper-alt (Generate a RESTful interface from JSON hive)

beekeeper is a Python library designed around dynamically generating
a RESTful client interface based on a minimal JSON hive.

The hive specification is designed to provide beekeeper (or other
applications consuming hive files) with programmatically-designed
insight into the structure of both the REST endpoints that are
available and the objects and methods that those endpoints represent.
