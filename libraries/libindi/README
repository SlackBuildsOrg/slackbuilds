INDI is a distributed control protocol designed to operate
astronomical instrumentation. INDI is small, flexible, easy to parse,
and scalable.  It supports common DCS functions such as remote
control, data acquisition, monitoring, and a lot more.

This script builds the library that KDE KStars and similar programs
can use for image capture in astrophotography, telescope control, etc.

You will need libindi-drivers (also on SBo) to fully utilize INDI
hardware.
