Supercat prints text files in a colorized manner based on regular
expression rules. By default it suports a handful of known filetypes,
such as C and Python source, ChangeLogs, diffs, etc. The real beauty
of this simple program though is that you can easily write your own
highlighting files with a little regex know-how.

PS: The default highlighting files are located in /etc/supercat.
