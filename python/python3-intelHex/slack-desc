# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-intelHex: python3-intelHex (Manipulate Intel Hex format data)
python3-intelHex:
python3-intelHex: The Intel HEX file format is widely used in microprocessors and
python3-intelHex: microcontrollers area (embedded systems etc) as the de facto standard
python3-intelHex: for representation of code to be programmed into microelectronic
