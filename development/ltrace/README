ltrace (library call trace utility)

ltrace intercepts and records dynamic library calls which are called
by an executed process and the signals received by that process. It can
also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.

Upgrade note: If you have /etc/ltrace.conf left over from a previous
version of ltrace, you should delete it, unless you've modified it
locally. Starting with 0.8.1, the config file has been split up
into multiple files and moved to /usr/share/ltrace. The man page
ltrace.conf(5) hasn't been updated to explain this, though.
