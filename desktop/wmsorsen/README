wmsorsen (windowmaker dockapp for cpu temp/fan/voltage sensors)

wmsorsen is a dockapp for WindowMaker (and similar window managers
supporting dockapps) for displaying hardware sensor values. It can
show up to 5 values, with custom labels.

After installing the package, per-user configuration is required.

1. cp /etc/wmsorsen.sample ~/.wmsorsenrc

2. Edit ~/.wmsorsenrc. Modify the monitor1 to monitor5 options to
   select the sensor values you want to see. Use "wmsorsen -p"
   to get a list of all available sensor values.
   You can use custom labels for each of the first 4 entries.
   Use "text? = foo", where ? is the number 1 to 4, and foo is the
   label (up to four characters).
