Microsoft Edge is a proprietary, cross-platform web browser 
created by Microsoft. It was first released in 2015 as part 
of Windows 10 and Xbox One and later ported to other 
platforms as a fork of Google's Chromium open-source 
project: Android and iOS, macOS, older Windows versions 
(Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later), and most 
recently Linux.
