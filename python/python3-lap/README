python3-lap (Linear Assignment Problem solver LAPJV/LAPMOD).

lap is a linear assignment problem solver using Jonker-Volgenant
algorithm for dense LAPJV¹ or sparse LAPMOD² matrices. Both algorithms
are implemented from scratch based solely on the papers¹˒² and the
public domain Pascal implementation provided by A. Volgenant³. The
LAPMOD implementation seems to be faster than the LAPJV implementation
for matrices with a side of more than ~5000 and with less than 50%
finite coefficients.

NOTE: While python3-numpy will build without it I highly suggest
      installing OpenBLAS before building numpy. I would add it to the
      REQUIRES for python3-lap but it will not be in the proper order
      for numpy to build against OpenBLAS.
