thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
Simple: It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.
Well, maybe a little more than the minimum. Small: It has a very
small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about
memory allocation. Portable: It compiles cleanly on most any Unix-like
OS. Fast: In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured
servers. Secure: It goes to great lengths to protect the web server
machine against attacks and breakins from other sites.

Notes:

By default the directory to serve through HTTP will be
'/var/www/thttpd'. If you want to change it, execute the SlackBuild as:
  # WEBDIR='/opt/www' sh thttpd.SlackBuild

To build and use this package the user/group 'thttpd' is required to
exists in your system. You can add it with:
  # groupadd -g 227 thttpd
  # useradd -u 227 -g 227 -c "User for thttpd" -d / -s /bin/false thttpd
