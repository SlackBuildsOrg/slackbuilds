teams-for-linux

Unofficial Microsoft Teams client for Linux using Electron. This app
wraps the web version of Teams as a standalone desktop application.

Teams for Linux was developed to provide a native-like desktop
experience by wrapping the web version in an Electron shell.

While we strive to add useful features and improvements, some
limitations are inherent because the app relies on the Microsoft Teams
web version. In cases where Microsoft controls the feature set (or
behavior), issues may be closed with an explanation.

We are not affiliated with Microsoft, and this project is not endorsed
by them. It is an independent effort to provide a better experience for
Linux users.

Please report bugs and enhancements in the issues section. We will
attend them as soon as possible. Please review the open/close issues
before raising a new one and avoid duplicates. We encourage everyone to
join our chat room in matrix and ask your questions. That's probably the
quickest way to find solutions.
