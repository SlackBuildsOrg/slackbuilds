Valijson is a header-only JSON Schema validation library for C++11.

Valijson provides a simple validation API that allows you to load
JSON Schemas, and validate documents loaded by one of several
supported parser libraries.

The goal of this project is to support validation of all constraints
available in JSON Schema v7, while being competitive with the
performance of a hand-written schema validator.
