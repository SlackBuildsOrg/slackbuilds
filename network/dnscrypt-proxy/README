dnscrypt-proxy is a tool for securing communications between a client
and a DNS resolver. It provides a local service which can be used
directly as your local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and
authenticating requests using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them
to an upstream server.

By default dnscrypt-proxy is configured to use a random DNS server;
you will definitely want to change this.

Note that google-go-lang is a compile-time dependency and is not
needed during run-time.

Be sure to read README.Slackware for information on configuring/running
dnscrypt-proxy as a daemon!
