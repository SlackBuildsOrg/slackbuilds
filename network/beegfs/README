BeeGFS aka. beegfs is a parallel filesystem that runs on
vanilla Linux kernel.
Officially supported filesystems for underlying local storage are
ext4, xfs, and zfs.

BeeGFS can be accessed through TCP and RDMA links.

Each file on beegfs can be stored in a specific storage pool.
Hard links and data/metadata mirroring are supported.

Authorization is required for production use of features such as
mirroring, quota enforcement (not quota tracking), and
more than one storage pools, etc.
Refer to the file "LICENSE.txt" for details.

openzfs is an optional run-time dependency.

Set BEEGFS_CTL_SUID to YES to install the beegfs-ctl program
setUID to root:

    env BEEGFS_CTL_SETUID=YES ./beegfs.SlackBuild

The client driver is kernel-dependent, so a re-compile of
this package is necessary for client nodes after a kernel-update.

Set KERNEL to the kernel version the client driver to be built for:

    env KERNEL=5.15.117 ./beegfs.SlackBuild

The default ./beegfs.SlackBuild is equivalent to

    env BEEGFS_CTL_SETUID=NO KERNEL=`uname -r` ./beegfs.SlackBuild
