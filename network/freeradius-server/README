FreeRADIUS Server (Radius protocol server)

The FreeRADIUS Server is a daemon for unix and unix like operating
systems which allows one to set up a radius protocol server, which can
be used for Authentication and Accounting various types of network
access.  To use the server, you also need a correctly setup client
which will talk to it, including terminal servers, Ethernet Switches,
Wireless Access Points or a PC with appropriate software which
emulates it (PortSlave, radiusclient etc).

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
