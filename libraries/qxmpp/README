QXmpp is a cross-platform C++ XMPP client and server library. It is
written in C++ and uses Qt framework.

QXmpp strives to be as easy to use as possible, the underlying TCP
socket, the core XMPP RFCs (RFC6120 and RFC6121) and XMPP extensions
have been nicely encapsulated into classes. QXmpp is ready to build
XMPP clients complying with the XMPP Compliance Suites 2022 for IM and
Advanced Mobile. It comes with full API documentation, automatic tests
and some examples.

QXmpp uses Qt extensively, and as such users need to a have working
knowledge of C++ and Qt basics (Signals and Slots and Qt data types).

Qt is the only third party library which is required to build QXmpp,
but libraries such as GStreamer enable additional features.
