TinTin++ is a terminal-based MUD/MOO/MUSH client designed to be
light and extensible. It includes a custom scripting language which
supports event triggers, timers, aliases, and speedwalking among
other features. It also supports the inclusion of external scripting
languages such as perl, python, or ruby via system calls.

TinTin++ supports MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol), MMCP (Mud
Master Chat Protocol), xterm 256 colors, most TELNET options used
by MUDs, as well as those required to login via telnet on Linux /
Mac OS X servers, and an auto mapper with a VT100 map display. Being
a console client TinTin++ works with most screen readers, and its
non graphical command interface makes the client particularly screen
reader / blind friendly.

Note: Executable is installed as /usr/bin/tt++ by default.
