Qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It's based
on Python and Qt and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and
Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

This SlackBuild installs all needed dependencies in a virtual
environment subfolder. This comes with an up-to-date Qt/PyQt including a
pre-compiled QtWebEngine binary, but has a couple of caveats:
* It only works on 64-bit x86 systems.
* It comes with a QtWebEngine compiled without proprietary codec support
  (such as h.264).

qt6 needed for this script can be built without webengine to speed up
compilation. If such an option is not available, just replace the line
tar xvf $CWD/$SRCNAM-$VERSION.tar.xz
with
tar xvf $CWD/$SRCNAM-$VERSION.tar.xz --exclude=qtwebengine
in qt6.SlackBuild.
