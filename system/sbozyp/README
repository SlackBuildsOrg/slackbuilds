Sbozyp is a package manager for SlackBuilds.org (SBo).

Sbozyp aims to strike a balance between being automatic like a
"normal" package manager such as apt, while still allowing for
manual use in a transparent and traditional Slackware-like way.

Sbozyp comes with a manual that fully details how to use it.

By default, sbozyp uses /var/lib/sbozyp to store a local copy
of the SBo repository and to cache downloaded sources. Also,
configuration files are stored in /etc/sbozyp. These
directories are not automatically removed when uninstalling
sbozyp and should be deleted manually if desired.
