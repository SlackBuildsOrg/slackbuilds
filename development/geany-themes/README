geany-themes (Geany editor color schemes)

Geany-themes is a collection of color schemes for the Geany
IDE/editor, either written originally by the Geany community or ported
from color schemes for other editors. These schemes are compatible
with Geany 1.22 and greater. Check out the screenshots to get an idea
for what each color scheme looks like:
