ishmael (Convert ebook documents to plain text)

ishmael is a Perl program that reads given ebook documents and
converts their contents to formatted plain text, which should be
suitable for piping into other programs for further processing. It
accomplishes this by converting the ebook contents to HTML and then
formatting that HTML using the dump feature found in many text web
browsers, like lynx. The formats it supports include EPUB,
FictionBook2, HTML, XHTML, Mobipocket, PalmDOC, PDF, zTXT, and plain
text.

Optional dependencies include w3m and elinks, which are alternative
HTML dumpers you can use to format the outputted text, although most
users will probably be satisfied with the formatting of links and
lynx, which are included with Slackware by default.
