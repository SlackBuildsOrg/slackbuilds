OpenAPV provides the reference implementation of the APV Codec.
which can be used to record professional grade video and
associated metadata without quality degradation. OpenAPV
is free and open source software.The primary purpose of
the APV codec is for use in high quality video recording
and post production.

The OpenAPV supports the following features:

1. fully compliant with 422-10 and 400-10 profile of APV
   codec
2. Low complexity by optimization for ARM NEON and x86(64bit)
   SEE/AVX CPU
3. Supports tile-based multi-threading
4. Supports Various metadata including HDR10/10+ and user-defined
   format
5. Constant QP (CQP), average bitrate (ABR), and constant rate
   factor (CRF) are supported

The APV codec standard has the following features:

1. Perceptually lossless video quality, which is close to raw video
   quality
2. Low complexity and high throughput intra frame only coding without
   pixel domain prediction
3. Support for high bit-rate range up to a few Gbps for 2K, 4K and 8K
   resolution content, enabled by a lightweight entropy coding scheme
4. Frame tiling for immersive content and for enabling parallel encoding
   and decoding
5. Support for various chroma sampling formats from 4:2:2 to 4:4:4, and
   bit-depths from 10 to 16
6. Support for multiple decoding and re-encoding without severe visual
   quality degradation
7. Support multi-view video and auxiliary video like depth, alpha, and
   preview
8. Support various metadata including HDR10/10+ and user-defined format
