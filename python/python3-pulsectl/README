Python (3.x and 2.x) blocking high-level interface and ctypes-based 
bindings for PulseAudio (libpulse), to use in a simple synchronous code.
Wrappers are mostly for mixer-like controls and introspection-related 
operations, as opposed to e.g. submitting sound samples to play and 
player-like client.
For async version to use with asyncio, see pulsectl-asyncio project 
instead.
Originally forked from pulsemixer project, which had this code bundled.
