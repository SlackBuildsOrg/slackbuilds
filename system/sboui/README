sboui is a package management tool for SlackBuilds.org (SBo). It
features an ncurses user interface that combines the user-friendliness
typically found in a GUI with the efficiency, light weight, and
portability of a text interface. It can function as a stand-alone
package manager or serve as a front-end to sbopkg, sbotools,
or custom package managers. Its main features include forward and
inverse dependency resolution, blacklisting, storing build options for
scripts, a menu bar, full mouse and keyboard support, and more.

Optional dependencies (see build options for more information):

psutil (for system tray notifier)
gksu, ktsuss (instead of kdesu to launch from the desktop)

Build options:

INSTALL_SYSTRAY_NOTIFIER=yes|no (default no): install a cronjob to sync
  the local repository hourly and display a system tray notification
  when SBo package updates are available. To use the system tray
  notifier, add sboui-update-notifier as a startup application for
  your desktop environment or window manager. If this is enabled,
  psutil becomes a dependency.

GRAPHICAL_SU=kdesu|gksu|ktsuss (default kdesu): change the graphical su
  command for launching sboui from the .desktop file and system tray
  notifier. gksu or ktsuss becomes a dependency if selected here.

TERMINAL_EMULATOR=(user choice; default xterm) set the terminal emulator
  to run sboui via the .desktop file and system tray notifier.

USE_NINJA=yes|no (default yes): use ninja instead of GNU Make for the
  build.
