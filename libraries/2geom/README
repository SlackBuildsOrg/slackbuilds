2Geom is a C++ 2D geometry library geared towards robust processing
of computational geometry data associated with vector graphics. The
primary design consideration is ease of use and clarity. It is dual
licensed under LGPL 2.1 and MPL 1.1.

The library is descended from a set of geometric routines present in
Inkscape, a vector graphics editor based around the Scalable Vector
Graphics format, the most widespread vector graphics interchange for-
mat on the Web and a W3C Recommendation. Due to this legacy, not all
parts of the API form a coherent whole (yet).

Rendering is outside the scope of this library, and it is assumed
something like libcairo or similar is employed for this.  2geom
concentrates on higher level algorithms and geometric computations.
