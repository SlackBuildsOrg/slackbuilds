python-nbxmpp is a Python library that provides a way for Python
applications to use Jabber/XMPP networks in a non-blocking way.

This library is initialy a fork of xmpppy one, but using
non-blocking sockets.

If you download with wget you should use the --content-disposition
option for that, or you'll end up with a file named 8 (although the
slackbuild checks for this file, too).
