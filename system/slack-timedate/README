This program implements timedated1 interface from systemd that is
required by GNOME Control Center and can be used by KDE Settings.

slack-timedate's purpose is to make it possible to enjoy full desktop
environment functionality on Slackware Linux which doesn't use
systemd as its init-system.

Since the maintainer of this package is also the author of the program,
fill free to contact me if you encounter any problems or bugs with it.
