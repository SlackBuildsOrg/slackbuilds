darkstat is a packet sniffing daemon that serves statistics over HTTP
using a builtin web server. Statistics can be refined using tcpdump
filter expression syntax.

Features:
- Traffic graphs, and reports per host, showing each port for each host.
- Embedded web-server with deflate compression.
- Asynchronous reverse DNS resolution using a child process.
- Small. Portable. Single-threaded. Efficient. Uncomplicated.

Once you have started darkstat (see the manpage), you can access your 
network monitor by pointing your browser to: http://youripaddress:667
