pastebinit (command-line pastebin client)

pastebinit is a small python script that simply sends whatever you
give it to an online pastebin and gives you the URL in return. It's
useful when doing IRC support (when you don't want one to paste a 200
line log) or when working on a command line box with no way to SSH
to it.

Maintainer's note: as of 2025-12-26, of the 14 pastebin sites
currently supported by pastebinit, five of them didn't work in
the SlackBuild author's testing:

- bpa.st (404 error)
- dpaste.org (403 error)
- paste.debian.net (redirects to the main page)
- paste.ubuntu.com (may work if you create an account and log in?)
- sprunge.us (404 error)

The default pastebin (with no -b option) is dpaste.com.
