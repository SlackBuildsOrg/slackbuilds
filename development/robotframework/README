Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance
testing and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).  It has
easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven
testing approach.  Its testing capabilities can be extended by test
libraries implemented either with Python or Java, and users can create
new higher-level keywords from existing ones using the same syntax that
is used for creating test cases.

python3 is an optional dependency.  It is needed for Python 3 support.
