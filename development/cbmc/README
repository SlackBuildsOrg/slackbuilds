CBMC

About CBMC

CBMC is a Bounded Model Checker for C and C++ programs.
It supports C89, C99, most of C11/C17 and most compiler extensions
provided by gcc, clang, and Visual Studio. A variant of CBMC that
analyses Java bytecode is available as JBMC.

CBMC verifies memory safety (which includes array bounds checks
and checks for the safe use of pointers), checks for exceptions,
checks for various variants of undefined behavior, and
user-specified assertions. Furthermore, it can check C and C++ for
I/O equivalence with other languages, such as Verilog. The
verification is performed by unwinding the loops in the program
and passing the resulting equation to a decision procedure.

CBMC is available for most flavours of Linux (pre-packaged on
Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora), Windows and MacOS X. You should also
read the CBMC license (BSD 4-clause). For questions about CBMC,
contact Daniel Kroening.

CBMC comes with a built-in solver for bit-vector formulas that is
based on MiniSat. As an alternative, CBMC has featured support for
external SMT solvers since version 3.3. The solvers we recommend
are (in no particular order) Boolector, CVC5 and Z3. Note that
these solvers need to be installed separately and have different
licensing conditions.

CBMC Documentation

-   The CPROVER Manual contains a tutorial from a user's point of
    view and describes what properties are checked.

-   A set of slides on CBMC: PDF, 2x3 handouts.
    The sources are available here.

-   The primary reference for CBMC is A Tool for Checking ANSI-C
    Programs (ca. 1900 citations).

We also have a list of interesting applications of CBMC.

If you need a Model Checker for Verilog or SMV files, consider
EBMC. For Java, use JBMC.
