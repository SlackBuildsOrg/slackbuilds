evince-gtk2 (a simple gnome-based document viewer)

This is the last GTK2 version of evince. It will conflict with the
latest one (the 'evince' build), so don't install both.

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It
currently supports PDF, PostScript, DjVu, TIFF, comic book archives,
and DVI. The goal of evince is to replace the multiple document
viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop with a single simple
application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the following file formats:
* PDF
* Postscript
* DjVu
* TIFF
* CBZ/CBR/CB7/CBT (comic books)
* DVI

Optional runtime dependencies:
- unrar or unrar-free. Required for CBR support.
- p7zip. Required for CB7 support.

By default, the package is built with NLS (Native Language Support)
disabled, so the user interface will only support English. This
doesn't have anything to do with the language a PDF/DjVu/etc file is
written in, only the text in the application itself (e.g. "File",
"Edit", "Previous", "Next"). If you require NLS support, run this
script with NLS=yes exported in the environemnt.
