Regina is a Rexx interpreter that has been ported to most Unix platforms
(Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.) and also to OS/2, eCS, DOS,
Win9x/Me/NT/2k/XP, Amiga, AROS, QNX4.x, QNX6.x, BeOS, MacOS X, EPOC32,
AtheOS, OpenVMS, SkyOS and OpenEdition.

Rexx is a programming language that was designed to be easy to use for
inexperienced programmers yet powerful enough for experienced users.
It is also a language ideally suited as a macro language for other
applications.

To create the normal dynamic library version just do this:

  bash regina-rexx.SlackBuild

Or to create a static version of the rexx binary executable do this:

  FLAVOR=static bash regina-rexx.SlackBuild

After installation of the package, a startup script for the rxstack is
created: /etc/rc.d/rc.rxstack

If this needs to run, then it could be started from the
/etc/rc.d/rc.local file.
