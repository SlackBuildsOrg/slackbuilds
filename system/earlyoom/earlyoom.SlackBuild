# 20240807 bkw: update for v1.8.2.
# 20230829 bkw: BUILD=2
# - add LICENSE and README.md to the doc dir.
# - binary in /usr/sbin, man page in section 8, since this is admin stuff.
# - have the init script delete the PID file after stop or force_stop.
# - actually use SLKCFLAGS.
# - make /etc/default/earlyoom a .new config file.
# - add a bit more detail to README.

# 20230829 bkw: prebuilt man page is a bit different from the generated one:
# - it's a section 8 page.
# - it has the date and "Linux System Administrator's Manual" filled in.
# - get rid of fancy unicode angle brackets for email addresses, just use <>.
