acidwarp (display geometric images and rotate the palette)

Acid Warp is an eye-candy program. Run it and watch the pretty
colors. Each picture is the graphic representation of a mathematical
function.

There is no man page. Run 'acidwarp -h' for a list of command-line
options, and see the docs in /usr/doc/acidwarp-$VERSION for a list
of keyboard commands. It's worth mentioning here that the keystroke
to exit is Control-Break, and that double-clicking in the window will
toggle windowed vs. fullscreen.

Build options:

By default, acidwarp is built with SDL-2.0 and OpenGL. To disable
OpenGL, set GL=no in the script's environment.

To build with SDL-1.2, set SDL2=no. This will also disable OpenGL,
since acidwarp doesn't support building with SDL-1.2 and OpenGL.
Building with SDL-1.2 actually has a use-case: it will allow "acidwarp
-f -k" to span multiple screens, if you have them (the SDL-2.0 build
only runs fullscreen on one monitor).
