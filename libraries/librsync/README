librsync (rsync synchronization algorithm library.)

librsync is a free software library that implements the rsync
remote-delta algorithm.

The rsync remote-delta algorithm is a method of efficiently
transmitting a structure (such as a file) across a communications link
when the receiving computer already has a different version of the
same structure.
