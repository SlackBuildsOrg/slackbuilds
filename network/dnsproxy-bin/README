dnsproxy is a simple DNS proxy server that supports all existing DNS
protocols including DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, DNSCrypt, and
DNS-over-QUIC. Moreover, it can work as a DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS
or DNS-over-QUIC server.

This script packages the official prebuilt binary.

A simple init script /etc/rc.d/rc.dnsproxy has been provided to run
dnsproxy as a daemon.

In most cases, dnsproxy should not be run as root. If there exists the
user dnsproxy, the script /etc/rc.d/rc.dnsproxy will run dnsproxy as
the user dnsproxy. This user can be created with:
  groupadd -g 384 dnsproxy
  useradd -u 384 -g 384 -s /sbin/nologin -M dnsproxy

If the user dnsproxy does not exist, then the script
/etc/rc.d/rc.dnsproxy will run dnsproxy as root.

Also, the script /etc/rc.d/rc.dnsproxy assumes that the configuration
file location is /etc/dnsproxy.yaml
