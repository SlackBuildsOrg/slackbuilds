PrismLauncher (An Open Source Minecraft launcher)

An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free
redistributability.

A Microsoft or Mojang account that owns Minecraft is required to
download and play the game through PrismLauncher.

zulu-openjdk17 can be used instead of OpenJDK17, if one wishes to do
so. If you plan on using a version of Minecraft that is on version
1.16.5 or older, you will also have to install either openjdk8 or
zulu-openjdk8. If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your
system, make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointed
to OpenJDK17 when building PrismLauncher.
