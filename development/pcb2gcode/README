pcb2gcode (Tool to create isolation milling toolpath from gerber file)

pcb2gcode is a command-line software for the isolation, routing and 
drilling of PCBs.

It takes Gerber files as input and it outputs gcode files, suitable
for the milling of PCBs.

It also includes an Autoleveller, useful for the automatic dynamic 
calibration of the milling depth.

pcb2gcodeGUI, the official GUI for pcb2gcode, is available at
