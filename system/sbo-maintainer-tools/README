sbo-maintainer-tools (sbolint and sbopkglint for SBo maintainers)

These are "lint" tools to make life easier for SlackBuilds.org
maintainers and admins:

sbolint: checks your SlackBuild, README, .info file, and slack-desc.
Also there's a git pre-commit hook you should use, that automatically
calls sbolint and stops you from committing bad code.

sbopkglint: checks your package, after it's built.
