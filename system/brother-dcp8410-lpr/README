This provides the LPR (Line Printer Remote protocol) driver for
Brother DCP-L8410CDW printer. It's merely a repackaging of the
official "deb" package.

You can check if everything is in order by executing:
$ lpinfo -v
  ...
  network lpd://BRWD0123456789A/BINARY_P1

If you plan to use CUPS by installing "brother-dcp8410-cups", then
no more steps are needed. CUPS will generate necessary lines in
/etc/printcap file and use its own spool directory.

If you decide, however, to use this package stand-alone, then you may
choose to set things up further, either by using the "setupPrintcapij"
script:
# /opt/brother/Printers/dcpl8410cdw/inf/setupPrintcapij dcpl8410cdw -i

Or manually:
# mkdir -p /var/spool/lpd/dcpl8410cdw
# chown lp /var/spool/lpd/dcpl8410cdw
# chgrp lp /var/spool/lpd/dcpl8410cdw
# cat <<EOF >> /etc/printcap
dcpl8410cdw:\\
  :mx=0:\\
  :sd=/var/spool/lpd/dcpl8410cdw:\\
  :sh:\\
  :lp=/dev/usb/lp0:\\
  :if=/opt/brother/Printers/dcpl8410cdw/lpd/filter_dcpl8410cdw:
EOF 

Take note of the "/dev/usb/lp0" value. This path is even hardcoded in
the "setupPrintcapij" script. You may need to change it according to
your needs.

For removal, you either reverse the manual steps or issue:
# /opt/brother/Printers/dcpl8410cdw/inf/setupPrintcapij dcpl8410cdw -e
