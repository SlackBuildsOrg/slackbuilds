Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying
coding standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static
source code analysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a
number of Perl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce
various coding guidelines. Most Policy modules are based on Damian
Conway's book Perl Best Practices. However, Perl::Critic is not
limited to PBP and will even support Policies that contradict Conway.
You can enable, disable, and customize those Polices through the
Perl::Critic interface.
