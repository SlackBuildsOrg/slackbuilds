gnsu (grahical frontend for sudo)

gnsu (gnsu's not su) allows a permitted user to execute a command with
superuser privileges, or as any other user. gnsu shows a graphical
dialog requesting the user password to allow the execution of the
specified command. The user, or a group the user is part of, has to be
allowed access to launching applications using sudo.

gnsu is similar to gksu, and can act as a replacement for it. If gksu is
not installed, gnsu will create symlinks for /usr/bin/{gksu,gksudo},
so software that expects to run commands via gksu will work with gnsu.

Note: you may have seen a gnsu-0.3.1 package from SalixOS. Do not ask
for this build to be "upgraded" to 0.3.1; it already includes Salix's
(very minor) changes. I used the version number of the latest official
gnsu release from its GitHub repository.
