# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Class-Inspector:
perl-Class-Inspector: Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class.
perl-Class-Inspector: Most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they
perl-Class-Inspector: aren't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high
perl-Class-Inspector: level of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code.
perl-Class-Inspector: Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier, more friendly
perl-Class-Inspector: interface to this information.
