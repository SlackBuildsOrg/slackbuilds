lxi-tools is a collection of open source software tools that enables control
of LXI compatible instruments such as modern oscilloscopes, power supplies,
spectrum analyzers etc.

All features are consolidated in the 'lxi' application which provides a simple
commandline interface to discover LXI instruments, send SCPI commands, and
capture screenshots from supported LXI instruments.

The lxi-tools package now features an optional GUI that requires the qt5
package.  Enable it with: GUI=yes ./lxi-tools.SlackBuild
