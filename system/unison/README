Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows
two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored
on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified
separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in
each replica to the other.

Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with
updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates
that do not conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates
are detected and displayed.

Unison allows you to either build a text-only binary or a binary that
will use a graphical user interface.

The dependency (lablgkt3) required for a GUI is currently not
available on slackbuilds.org, so this defaults to a text only build.

This slackbuild supports, similar to Slackware's own emacs package,
building both a text-only and a gui binary. To do this, you would
need to install lablgtk3 somehow yourself and then:

  "FLAVOUR='gtk3 text' ./unison.SlackBuild"

Please also consider submitting the build for others to use.

hevea is an optional dependency which allows building the HTML
documentation. Otherwise only PDF docs will be built.
