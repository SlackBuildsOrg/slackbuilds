9pro -- Plan9-related tools for Unix-like operating systems.

* 9pex - share a directory over stdin/stdout, can be used with socat/inetd
* 9gc  - a very simple stdin/stdout 9gridchan client

This is all _WIP_ still.  9pex is working in read-only mode so far but
lacks proper auth, async IO, some more error control etc.
