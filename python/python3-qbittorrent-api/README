python3-qbittorrent-api (Python client implementation for qBittorrent)

Python client implementation for qBittorrent Web API.

NOTE: This is a required dependency for another program, but it is not
required to be functional. Rather than adding all the dependencies of
qbittorrent itself, qbittorrent will not be added to REQUIRES line. If
you need qbittorrent support with this module, you will need to install
qbittorent itself.

ALSO NOTE: Unable to update to newer versions. Needs setuptools>=67 and
setuptools-scm>=8, which is not currently available on 15.0 or SBo's
packages.
