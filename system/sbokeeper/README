sbokeeper (SlackBuild package manager helper)

sbokeeper is a tool that can help a Slackware system administrator
keep track of their installed SlackBuilds by maintaining a database of
added packages and their dependencies. It is not a package manager
itself, it simply helps in the task of managing SlackBuilds.
