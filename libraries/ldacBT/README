ldacBT (libraries for encoding using lossy LDAC)

LDAC is a bluetooth codec of Hi-Res Audio Wireless.  It's mainly used
in devices made by Sony, which is also the author of this proprietary
codec.

The codec allows streaming lossy audio over Bluetooth connections at
up to 990 kbps at 32 bits/96 kHz.

This provides libldacBT_enc.so (CBR) and libldacBT_abr.so (AVR or
Adaptive Bit Rate) libraries.

NOTE: in order to use LDAC profile for a Bluetooth audio device,
      corresponding package (e.g., "pipewire" from the base system)
      needs to be rebuilt after this package is installed, unless the
      libraries are loaded dynamically.
