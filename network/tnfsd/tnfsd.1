.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
tnfsd [\fB\-a\fP] [\fB\-r\fP] [\fB\-p\fP \fIport\fP] [\fB\-u\fP \fIusername\fP \fB\-g\fP \fIgroup\fP] \fBdirectory\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
TNFS is a simplified Internet file transfer protocol, designed for
simplicity and ease of implementation on small systems, such as 8\-bit
computers. It\(aqs simpler than NFS, SMB, or FTP. It\(aqs similar to TFTP,
but has features TFTP lacks.
.sp
\fBtnfsd\fP is the server for the TNFS protocol. It listens for clients
on UDP and TCP ports 16384 by default. Although TCP is supported, most
clients use UDP only... maybe \fIall\fP clients?
.sp
The mandatory \fBdirectory\fP option is the root of the TNFS
filesystem tree. With the \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-g\fP options, \fBtnfsd\fP will
\fBchroot\fP(2) to this directory.
.sp
Even without \fBchroot\fP, \fBtnfsd\fP will not deliberately allow access
to files outside the \fIdirectory\fP\&. The \fB\-u\fP/\fB\-g\fP chroot option
is a safety net, in case there\(aqs a bug in \fBtnfsd\fP that allows such
access (currently, no such bug is known of).
.sp
Note that \fBtnfsd\fP can be started by a normal user, since it uses an
unprivileged port number. The \fB\-u\fP/\fB\-g\fP options won\(aqt work in this case.
.sp
\fBtnfsd\fP logs various information to standard error. If compiled with
\fI\-DUSAGE_LOG\fP, the log includes all mount, umount, and file transfer
requests including the client IP addresses.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP
Set the port number to listen to for UDP and TCP. Default: \fI16384\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-r\fP
Read\-only. Attempts to upload, delete, or modify files will fail.
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP
Atari 8\-bit mode. Binary files will be wrapped in a bootable \fBATR\fP image.
.TP
.B \fB\-u\fP \fIuser\fP \fB\-g\fP \fIgroup\fP
Causes \fBtnfsd\fP to \fBchroot\fP to \fIdirectory\fP, then set its user and
group IDs to \fIuser\fP and \fIgroup\fP\&. Requires \fBtnfsd\fP to be started as root.
If \fB\-u\fP is used, \fB\-g\fP is required (and vice versa); it\(aqs an error
to give only one of these options.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNote:\fP Older versions of \fBtnfsd\fP used the \fB\-c\fP option to chroot. Scripts
that start \fBtnfsd\fP will have to be updated to use \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-g\fP instead.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
\fBtnfsd\fP is designed to be simple, so the following list of
limitations should not be read as complaints or feature requests.
.sp
There\(aqs no way to limit which hosts may access \fBtnfsd\fP using any
mechanism such as \fBtcpd\fP(8), and there\(aqs no way to have \fBtnfsd\fP
bind to a particular interface (it listens on all of them). Firewall
rules may be used instead, e.g. \fBiptables\fP(8).
.sp
There isn\(aqt a way to selectively share some subdirectories read\-only
with the current \fBtnfsd\fP implementation. The \fB\-r\fP option applies
to the whole tree. However, without \fB\-r\fP, filesystem permissions can
be used to prevent the daemon from writing to directories you want to
be read\-only while allowing writes to other dirs.
