GFS was founded in 1992 by the late Michael S. Macrakis 
(1925–2001) as a Non-Profit Organization with the expressed 
aim of contributing to the research of Greek typography. 
The Society was founded initially by the Kostopoulos Foundation, 
with further support provided by the Greek Ministry of Culture, 
the Leventis Foundation,Regis College-USA,the Maliotis Foundation 
and the Girondelis Foundation.Furthermore, the Greek Literary 
and Historical Archives (ELIA) offered valuable support by providing 
office space for the first four years of GFS’s operation. 

GFS was founded with the express aim to research the history of 
Greek typography and the design of historic and contemporary Greek 
typefaces, which shall bridge the gap between metal and digital 
technology.GFS has released all its digital fonts free for every 
application and supports each one with polytonic typesetting
