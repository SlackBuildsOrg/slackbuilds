The syslog-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system
logging application that is ideal for creating centralized and trusted
logging solutions. This free, open-source version is an extremely
well-developed, high performance, stable system being the Linux/Unix
world's most frequently used alternative central logging system. The
application can operate in server or agent mode, and - apart from UDP
- supports the reliable TCP and the encrypted TLS protocols. That
way syslog-ng can be used to create flexible and reliable logging
infrastructure even in heterogeneous environments.

libdbi is an optional dependency (enables SQL support). GeoIP support
can be enabled with: GEOIP=yes ./syslog-ng.SlackBuild

This package will conflict with sysklogd - in other words, you *need*
to remove sysklogd before installing syslog-ng.

For more information on how to install and run syslog-ng, see
README.SLACKWARE that came with this package (which is also installed
with the docs).
