# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

roxterm: roxterm (gtk terminal emulator)
roxterm:
roxterm: ROXTerm is a terminal emulator that uses the same VTE library as
roxterm: gnome-terminal. Originally aimed at being a lightweight gtk terminal,
roxterm: it has since grown in features and is now quite comparable to the
roxterm: default GNOME/Xfce/Mate terminals. It is still a favorite among
roxterm: "power" users due to its high configurability. The name comes from
roxterm: the ROX desktop, although ROXTerm can be used anywhere.
