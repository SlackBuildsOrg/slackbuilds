# Previously maintained by Gerardo Zamudio.
# Now maintained by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>.

# 20170825 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance.
# - Update for v2.1.3.
# - slack-desc cosmetics.
# - Don't install useless INSTALL to doc dir.
# - Remove -j1 from the make commands, except the one for keycodes. seems
#   not to be needed any longer.
# - Simplify script a bit.
# - Build a private static 'libvterm', which is NOT the same libvterm as
#   libraries/libvterm on SBo. Unfortunately this adds a lot of complexity
#   back to the script :(
# - Rebase patches/*.diff against 2.1.3 and combine into one patch.

# First, the library. This is "libvterm", by the same author as vwm,
# but it's completely unrelated to the libvterm on SBo. Two projects
# happened to pick the same name. This one doesn't build a static lib
# by default (which we need) so it's done here with 'ar'. None of this
# stuff gets included in the package.
# libvterm-20170804.tar.xz was created thus:
