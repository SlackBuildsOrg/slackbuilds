python3-pooch (A friend to fetch your data files)

Does your Python package include sample datasets? Are you shipping
them with the code? Are they getting too big?

Pooch is here to help! It will manage a data registry by downloading
your data files from a server only when needed and storing them
locally in a data cache (a folder on your computer).
