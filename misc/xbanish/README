xbanish (hides the mouse cursor while typing)

xbanish hides the mouse cursor when you start typing and makes it
reappear when you move the mouse. It's useful for keeping the cursor
out of the way while working in a terminal or writing text.

To use it, simply run:

  xbanish &

It runs in the background and starts working immediately.
