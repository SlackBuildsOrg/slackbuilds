oidentd (an identd daemon)

Oidentd is an ident daemon (rfc1413) that runs on Linux, FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and Solaris 2.x. Oidentd supports most features of pidentd
plus more. Most notably, oidentd allows users to specify the identd
response that the server will output when a successful lookup is
completed. Oidentd supports IP masqueraded connections on Linux, and
is able to forward requests to hosts that masq through the host on
which oidentd runs.

This is a fork of the ojnk oidentd released in 2006
