Pyogrio provides a GeoPandas-oriented API to OGR vector data sources,
such as ESRI Shapefile, GeoPackage, and GeoJSON. Vector data sources
have geometries, such as points, lines, or polygons, and associated
records with potentially many columns worth of data.

Pyogrio uses a vectorized approach for reading and writing GeoDataFrames
to and from OGR vector data sources in order to give you faster
interoperability. It uses pre-compiled bindings for GDAL/OGR so that the
performance is primarily limited by the underlying I/O speed of data
source drivers in GDAL/OGR rather than multiple steps of converting to
and from Python data types within Python.
