transmission-remote-gtk (transmission remote control GUI)

transmission-remote-gtk is a cross-platform application for remote
management of the Transmission BitTorrent client using its RPC
interface.

 * Remotely add (file/url), start, stop, remove, remove & delete,
   verify, reannounce torrents.
 * Works as a .torrent handler (eg. from a web browser).
 * Set torrent properties such as speed, seed, peer limits, file
   priorities, add/edit/remove trackers.
 * Change remote settings like global limits, download directory, and
   connectivity preferences.
 * UI translations for many languages.

If you find desktop notifications annoying/distracting, or use
a non-desktop window manager, export NOTIFY=no in the script's
environment to build without libappindicator.

Note: previous versions of transmission-remote-gtk had GeoIP
support. This has been dropped in version 1.7.0, apparently because it
didn't work properly.
