Dealer's Choice is a cross-platform, networked multiplayer poker game
that supports various draw and stud variants, including optional wild
cards. The deal rotates between players, and each new game allows a
different player to choose the variant.

This requires a newer version of meson (python3-meson-opt, available
in the SBo repository), than what's included with stock Slackware.
