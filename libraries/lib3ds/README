lib3ds is an overall software library for managing 3D-Studio Release 3
and 4 ".3DS" files. It is a free alternative to Autodesk's 3DS File
Toolkit for managing 3DS files. It started out in 1996 to be released
in 1999 under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as Open-Source
software. In 2000, the library was completely rewritten in ANSI-C to
attain more hardware platform independence. To enable commercial
application the license was changed to GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL).
