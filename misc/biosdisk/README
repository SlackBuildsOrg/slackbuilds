biosdisk is a bunch of scripts are creating disk images with freedos
and autoexec.bat to automatically run the bios executable.

It should be suitable for any update of firmware or BIOS that can run
from diskette and freeDOS.

You can create (with mkisofs) a cd iso image that contains the floppy
image.
