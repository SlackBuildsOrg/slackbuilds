Heimdall is a cross-platform open-source tool suite used to flash
firmware (aka ROMs) onto Samsung mobile devices.

The "Heimdall Suite" is composed by:
Heimdall command line
Heimdall Frontend.

Heimdall command line package includes: Heimdall command line tool and
udev rules (for non-root USB access).

Heimdall Frontend package includes: Heimdall Frontend - GUI only.

So, this script comes with an option (GUI) that can be set at build
time.

The default is GUI=yes, but if you don't want to install the frontend,
you could do that by setting GUI to 'no' in command line:

GUI=no ./heimdall.SlackBuild

Don't forget to reloaded udev after installing this package
/etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload

DISCLAIMER:

This software attempts to flash your Galaxy S device. The very nature
of flashing is dangerous. As with all flashing software, Heimdall has
the potential to damage (brick) your phone if not used carefully. If
you're concerned, don't use this software. Flashing ROMs onto your
phone may also void your warranty. Benjamin Dobell and Glass Echidna
are not responsible for the result of your actions.
