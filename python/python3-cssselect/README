python3-cssselect (CSS Selectors for Python)

cssselect is a BSD-licensed Python library to parse CSS3 selectors
and translate them to XPath 1.0 expressions.

XPath 1.0 expressions can be used in lxml or another XPath engine
to find the matching elements in an XML or HTML document.

Note: This can coexist with python2-cssselect without issue.

Also note: This has a circular optional dependency with lxml. If
desired, rebuild this after installing lxml.
