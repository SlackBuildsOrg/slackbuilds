gnome-boxes is a simple GNOME application to access virtual machines.

Important Note:
gnome-boxes is a graphical front end for qemu/libvirt. You will need to
install 'qemu' in order to make use of gnome-boxes. There is a qemu
build available on slackbuilds.org. Please install *all* of the
optional dependencies listed for qemu for proper compatibility with
gnome-boxes.

gnome-boxes can be built and run without qemu, but you will not be able
to run any virtual machines from gnome-boxes until qemu is installed.
