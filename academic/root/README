ROOT - A data analysis framework.

ROOT provides a set of frameworks with the functionality needed to
handle and analyze large amounts of data in an efficient way. It
includes specialized storage methods such as histograms, curve
fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics, visualization
classes; the C++ interpreter cling for fast prototyping; and powerful
parallel processing support.

It comes with a lot of different options for compilation. And it
seems impossible to stress all of them in this one script. Therefore
the potential user is strongly advised to check the cmake command
arguments.

Compilation takes quite a while, thus consider to build ROOT like that:
# MAKEFLAGS=-j5 ./root.SlackBuild

REQUIREMENTS: gl2ps libAfterImage python3-numpy tbb ftgl

NOTES:
  - ROOT's python TMVA requires python3-numpy being built over blas.

  - This SlackBuild sets the root7 build option to ON in order to
    prepare the migration to the new ROOT 7 release. More on the ROOT 7
    features you can find here:
        https://root.cern/for_developers/root7

  - Starting from ROOT version 6.26/00 it uses the web-based version for
    the TBrowser if it is build with the root7 option being ON. You can
    switch back to the Win95-looking TBrowser by adding the following
    line to your $HOME/.rootrc file:
        Browser.Name: TRootBrowser

  - Starting from ROOT 6.28/00 version, one can use rootssh script for
    automatic configuration of ssh tunnel, necessary for web widgets:
        rootssh username@remotenode
