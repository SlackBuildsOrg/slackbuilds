Audio Tag Tool is a program to manage the information fields in MP3
and Ogg Vorbis files, commonly called tags. It is available under the
GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

Tag Tool can be used to edit tags one by one, but the most useful
features are the ability to easily tag or rename hundreds of files at
once, in any desired format.

This version is a port to GTK+3 of the original tagtool project on
SourceForge, which last had a release in 2008.
