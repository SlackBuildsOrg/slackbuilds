Mgen + is a composite font that uses a variety of kanji 
and symbols based on the free font "M + OUTLINE FONTS", 
and by supplementing the glyphs of the kanji and symbols 
that are not included in it with "Noto Sans CJK / 
Source Sans Japanese part",  This enhancement enables the 
use of a wider variety of kanji and symbols. 

This is a repackage for Slackware Linux.
