yt-dlp (download videos from youtube)

***********************************************************************
WARNING: This build is outdated, and can no longer be updated on
Slackware 15.0, due to Python 3.9 reaching EOL in October, 2025. If
you need an updated yt-dlp that actually works with Google's latest
changes to the Youtube site, use yt-dlp-bin instead.
***********************************************************************

yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork based on the now inactive youtube-dlc. The
main focus of this project is adding new features and patches while
also keeping up to date with the original project.

yt-dlp conflicts with yt-dlp-bin. Only install one or the other.

yt-dlp has several optional runtime dependencies, which aren't
required for most common use cases. They don't have to be installed
before yt-dlp is built, and can be installed after yt-dlp (which won't
need a rebuild).

mutagen: Required for embedding thumbnails in mp4 files (the
--embed-thumbnail option).

phantomjs: Used in extractors where JavaScript needs to be run. It's
not clear to the SlackBuild author which content providers need this;
YouTube does not.

python3-websockets: Required for downloading over WebSocket ("ws://"
and "wss://" URLs). If you've never heard of the WebSocket protocol,
you probably don't need this.

pycryptodomex: For decrypting AES-128 HLS streams and various other
data. It's not clear to the SlackBuild author what content providers
use AES-128. YouTube does not, that I've ever seen.

secretstorage: For --cookies-from-browser to access the Gnome keyring
while decrypting cookies of Chromium-based browsers on Linux.

xattr: For the --xattrs and --xattr-set-filesize option.

If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are
attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available
dependencies are visible at the top of the --verbose output.
