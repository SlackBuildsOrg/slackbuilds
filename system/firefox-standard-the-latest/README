Installing and Maintaining an updated Firefox Standard on Slackware
is now made easier with this small program, "firefox-standard-the-latest".
It is a simple python script that checks what is the latest
version available and updates it on your Slackware box.

It identifies a new version by parsing the web-page at
https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/the-latest-version/firefox
and comparing with the firefox version number currently installed.
Firefox is then downloaded directly from Mozilla, packed into
a Slackware package using makepkg, and installed.

You can run this script manually or automatically with the
provided cron.hourly script. The cron script will attempt to
identify which user to notify, otherwise you can edit it and set
the variable USERNAME=’your username’

In order to avoid excessive hits on whatismybrowser.com actual
checks are limited to "once a day", but you can bypass this with the
arguments "install", "upgrade" or "update". These all mean then
same and imply a download from Mozilla and perform an install or
an upgrade, if one is required of course.
Normally it is asked if you want to install the new version, but
providing the argument "silent" will just update with no
human intervention.
The argument "gui" allows you to manually install or upgrade
the browser.

Note 1: This program runs in the background.  To collect your input,
dialogs appear and disappear. Don't be alarmed and wait for the
program to end.

Note 2: This program installs the Firefox **Standard** not the **ESR**
Release that is part stock Slackware. Both releases can be installed
at the same time on the same machine.


Workflows:

1. Every day the program checks if a new browser is available
   and notifies you through a pop-up window. This is default behavior.

2. You can start the program manually using the icon available
   in the desktop menu to trigger the download, check and
   install/upgrade the browse if required.

3. From the command line, if you don't have yet Firefox Standar installed
   you can do so by simply by running:
   /opt/firefox-standard-the-latest/firefox-standard-the-latest.py install

4. From the command line, you can force a Firefox download and
   upgrade if required, without any pop-up window, with:
   /opt/firefox-standard-the-latest/firefox-standard-the-latest.py silent upgrade
