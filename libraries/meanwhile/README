The Meanwhile Project is an open implementation of the Lotus Sametime
Community Client protocol. The Meanwhile Project is neither endorsed
by nor affiliated with Lotus or IBM. It is an independent project
aiming to fill a space Lotus has left vacant.

The heart of the Meanwhile Project is the Meanwhile library,
providing the basic Lotus Sametime session functionality along with
the core services; Presence Awareness, Instant Messaging, Multi-user
Conferencing, Preferences Storage, Identity Resolution, and File
Transfer. This extensible client interface allows additional services
to be added to a session at runtime, allowing for simple integration
of future service handlers such as the user directory and whiteboard
and screen-sharing.
