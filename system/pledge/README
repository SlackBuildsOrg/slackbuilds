pledge is a port of OpenBSD's syscall to Linux by Justine Tunney.
This script builds a shared library (used to be injected via LD_PRELOAD)
and a command line utility to restrict program exection privileges and
limit parameters as maximum niceness, cpu time, virtual memory, file
descriptors, child proccess and individual file sizes.

NOTE:
* pledge help is available via the -h option
* to run pledge at glibc executable load time:
  strace -vff bash -c \
    '_PLEDGE=4194303,0 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/pledge/sandbox.so ls'
  or, on 64-bit systems:
  strace -vff bash -c \
    '_PLEDGE=4194303,0 LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/pledge/sandbox.so ls'
