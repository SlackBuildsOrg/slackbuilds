Userspace utilities and firmware for Hauppauge PVR cards.

Note that the header files ivtv.h and ivtvfb.h included in the source
tarball are already provided by the Linux kernel headers, so the
included build script removes these.

Similarly, two binaries v4l2-ctl and ivtv-ctl are provided by v4l-utils
(assuming you did a full Slackware installation) and therefore the in-
cluded build script removes those too.
