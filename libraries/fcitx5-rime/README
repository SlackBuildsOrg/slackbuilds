This package provides Rime support for fcitx5.

Please note that this package (and librime) *does not* give you a
working Rime setup; you'd still need to connect to the Internet and
install Plum, Rime's schema manager, to install and manage schemas.
Please refer to <https://github.com/rime/plum> for a complete install
guide, but for basic usage, run in a desired directory:

  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rime/plum.git
  cd plum
  rime_frontend=fcitx5-rime bash rime-install :preset

After running this, you'll have a basic Rime set up.
