sbotools (ports-like interface to slackbuilds.org)

sbotools is a set of Perl scripts providing a ports-like automation
interface to slackbuilds.org. Features include dependency handling,
using a custom git branch, generating 32-bit and compat32 builds on
multilib systems, reverse dependency search and more.

There is a man page for each included command. For 'executive
summaries' and online man pages, see the project's home page.

sbotools bundles the required Perl module Sort::Versions. This does
not interfere with a copy installed from the CPAN or from
slackbuilds.org.

sbotools installs a default configuration file to
/etc/sbotools/sbotools.conf.new. sbotools.conf files from version 2.7
are compatible, but some of the options are new. It may be convenient
to examine the new file for added options and annotation when upgrading
from version 2.7.

sbotools is incompatible with sbotools3 (which was briefly on
SlackBuilds.org). Removing sbotools3 before installing sbotools is
advised.

Please note that sbotools-3.x is based on an actively-maintained fork
of the repository used for versions 1.9 through 2.7. A debt of gratitude
is owed to the original author, Jacob Pipkin, longtime maintainer
Andreas Guldstrand and major contributor Luke Williams.
