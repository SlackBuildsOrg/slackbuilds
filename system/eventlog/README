The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the simple syslog()
API provided on UNIX systems. The major difference between EventLog
and syslog is that EventLog tries to add structure to messages.

Where you had a simple non-structrured string in syslog() you have a
combination of description and tag/value pairs.

EventLog provides an interface to build, format and output an event
record. The exact format and output method can be customized by the
administrator via a configuration file.
