The Python package for near duplicate video detection

Videohash is a for **detecting near-duplicate videos (Perceptual Video
Hashing)**. It can take any input video and generate a 64-bit
equivalent hash value. Videohash is way more faster than comparing the
imagehash values of individual of the video and more reliable than
hashing.

The video-hash-values for identical or near-duplicate videos are the
same or similar, implying that if the video is resized
upscaled/downscaled, transcoded, watermark added/removed, stabilized,
color changed, frame rate changed, changed aspect ratio, cropped,
black-bars added or removed, the hash-value should remain unchanged or
not vary substantially.
