Memtest86+ is thorough, stand alone memory test for Intel/AMD x86
architecture systems. BIOS based memory tests are only a quick check
and often miss failures that are detected by Memtest86+.

This package installs a bootable image to /boot/memtest86+.bin
which is similar to the kernel images in the same directory.


LILO users:  Append this to your /etc/lilo.conf:

  image = /boot/memtest86+.bin
    label = memtest86+

Then run `/sbin/lilo` to update the boot loader.
Don't forget to re-run `/sbin/lilo` if you upgrade this package.


GRUB 2 users:  Should be added automatically.

/etc/grub.d/60_memtest86+* scripts have been added so you just need
to run /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig.

See /usr/doc/memtest86+-$VERSION/README for more info.
