FFTW (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) is a free collection of
fast C routines for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in
one or more dimensions. It includes complex, real, symmetric, and
parallel transforms, and can handle arbitrary array sizes efficiently.
FFTW is typically faster than other publicly-available FFT
implementations, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned libraries.

fftw-mpi is an extended version of the fftw package released with the
official Slackware because includes the support to MPI-2 implementation
given by Open MPI, not available in the Slackware distributions.

Warning
Do not update fftw with fftw-mpi of viceversa using pkgtool!

fftw-mpi is an alternative to the Slackware fftw, so these packages can
not coexist and cannot be managed with the commands of pkgtool. Make
sure to remove the Slackware fftw package installed before build or
install fftw-mpi. If launched, the slackbuild script looks for any
system fftw and will stop if this does not appear installed from
fftw-mpi slackbuild.
Vice versa, make sure to remove fftw-mpi before install the fftw
package released by the official Slackware repositories.

After installing fftw-mpi you have also to add fftw in the blacklist of
slackpkg because the command slackpkg install-new does not recognize
fftw-mpi as alternative to fftw.
