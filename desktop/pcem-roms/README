pcem-roms (rom file collection for PCem)

pcem-roms is a collection of rom files that can be used with the PCem
emulator. Once installed, the files will be in /usr/share/pcem/roms,
ready to be used by PCem.

These files are all proprietary (excluding xtide), and the archive comes
from upstream without a license. Granted, none of the roms in the
collection could be described as "recent" by any stretch of the
imagination.

Some files for the mach64g were included at the time PCem 17 was
released, but have since been removed from the upstream GitHub
repository. They are mostly Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 drivers and other
Windows utilities. Although these files will not be installed by
default, use EXTRAS=yes to include them.

Two rom files are known to be missing from the collection:

  Hyundai Super 16T
    super16t_v1.12ta.bin
  Hyundai Super 16TE
    super16te_v2.00id.bin
