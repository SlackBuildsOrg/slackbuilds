Node.js 22.x (LTS) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8
JavaScript engine.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it
lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the
largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

NOTE: This conflicts with other nodejs versions on SBo.
