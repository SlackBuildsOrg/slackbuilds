# 20181206 bkw:
# - Add missing 'six' dependency. Thanks to Carsten Boysen Jensen for
#   the bug report. BUILD=2

# 20181013 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance.
# - Update for v2.4.0. Incompatible changes, can't build the old
#   version with VERSION=2.0, sorry.
# - Upstream removed all the cardsets from the source tarball, moved
#   them to a separate "minimal" cardset tarball, so add it to DOWNLOAD
#   and script stuff to handle it.
# - Get rid of the option to include the complete cardsets tarball. Moved
#   to a separate pysylfc-extra-cardsets build.
# - Install the correct man page for the FC edition, not the old pre-fork
#   pysol one.
# - Include all_games.html in the docdir (with fixed paths for the links).
# - Update README and slack-desc.

# 20181012 bkw: Slightly dirty hack, to combat a dirty hack from upstream.
# Begin rant:
# Basically, the old versions of pysol used the python 'random' library,
# which ships with python2 (included in Slackware). With 2.4.0, they've
# ported the code so it's python3-compatible (though it still works
# with python2). The python3 random library is API-incompatible with
# the python2 one... so someone ported the python2 random to python3
# and named it 'random2'. random2 is also python2-compatible... so the
# PySolFC devs changed their code to require random2, even on python
# 2. So I'm changing it back, to avoid adding an extra (redundant) dependency.
# The reason for going into such detail about it here, is that maintainers
# of other python-based packages might run into the same issue someday.
# I'll have a handy URL to point them to with the fix.
# Here endeth the rant.
