gnome-autoar provides functions and widgets for GNOME applications
which want to use archives as a method to transfer directories over
the Internet.

Creating and extracting archives is easy, safe, and automatic.
One module is created (gnome-autoar) and three modules are modified
(Epiphany, Evolution, Empathy). The two major steps of this project
are:
  * An wrapper for libarchive, GIO, and GTK+, provides GObject-based
    C API for archives and a few common widgets.
  * Integrate archives into applications. I try to use existing
    widgets in applications to show archive works and user
    preferences settings. 

Below variables can be used to configure the build:
    INTROSPECTION=enabled : Build introspection support
    GTKDOC=true           : Build GTK Doc reference
    TESTS=true            : Build tests
    VAPI=true             : Build vala bindings
