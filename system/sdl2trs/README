sdl2trs (Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P Emulator)

sdl2trs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for
Macintosh OSX, Windows and Linux. It has been ported from the
excellent X Window Unix emulator xtrs. Instead of using the X-Window
system for graphics, it uses the portable SDL library.

This build uses SDL-2.0, which is designed for newer machines. If you
have an older machine, or if sdl2trs doesn't perform well on your
system, try the SDL-1.2 version, sdl2trs. It's possible to install
both sdl2trs and sdl2trs on the same system with no conflicts.

Note: When you start up sdl2trs for the first time, it attempts
to boot from floppy disk. If you didn't give either the "-disk0
/path/to/image.dsk" or "-nofloppy" options on the command line, it
will "hang" with a black screen, because it's trying to boot from a
nonexistent floppy disc. To recover from this:

- Hold down F10 (TRS-80 Reset) and press Escape (TRS-80 Break key) to
  skip the disk boot and enter the ROM BASIC.

- Press Alt+D to enter the emulator's disk menu, and from there,
  either select a bootable disk image for drive 0, or disable the
  floppy disk controller. Then press Shift-F10 to reboot the TRS-80.

See the man page and the documentation at
/usr/doc/sdl2trs-$VERSION/html/index.html for further details.
