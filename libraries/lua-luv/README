This library makes libuv available to lua scripts. It was made for the
luvit project but should usable from nearly any lua project.

The library can be used by multiple threads at once. Each thread
is assumed to load the library from a different lua_State. Luv will
create a unique uv_loop_t for each state. You can't share uv handles
between states/loops.
