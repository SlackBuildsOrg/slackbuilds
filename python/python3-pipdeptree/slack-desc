# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pipdeptree: python3-pipdeptree (Show dependency trees of python packages)
python3-pipdeptree:
python3-pipdeptree: pipdeptree is a command line utility for displaying the installed
python3-pipdeptree: python packages in form of a dependency tree. It works for packages
python3-pipdeptree: installed globally on a machine as well as in a virtualenv. Since pip
python3-pipdeptree: freeze shows all dependencies as a flat list, finding out which are
python3-pipdeptree: the top level packages and which packages do they depend on requires
python3-pipdeptree: some effort.
