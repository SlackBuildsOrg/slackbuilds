Baudline is a time-frequency browser designed for scientific
visualization of the spectral domain. Signal analysis is performed
by Fourier, correlation, and raster transforms that create colorful
spectrograms with vibrant detail. Conduct test and measurement
experiments with the built in function generator, or play back audio
files with a multitude of effects and filters. The baudline signal
analyzer combines fast digital signal processing, versatile high speed
displays, and continuous capture tools for hunting down and studying
elusive signal characteristics.

Baudline is only available in binary format. There is an included
baudline_jack client which can make use of the jack audio connection
kit.

Note: Baudline requires the use of the AOSS wrapper from alsa-oss to
be able to use sound without jack. The desktop file already has this
provision.
