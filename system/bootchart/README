Bootchart provides a shell script to be run by the kernel in the
init phase. The script will run in background and collect process
information, CPU statistics and disk usage statistics from the /proc
file system. The performance data are stored in memory and are
written to disk once the boot process completes.

The boot log file is later processed using a Java application which
builds the process tree and renders a performance chart in different
formats (png, svg, eps).

After installation, to run bootchartd;
a) if you run a huge kernel or custom kernel without initrd:
append the following boot option: 
  init=/sbin/bootchartd

b) If you run a kernel using initrd:
Run the script mkchartd with proper options and append to lilo
configuration file a new entry for bootchart specifying:
  initrd /boot/initrd.chart.gz

Remember to run lilo after applying changes.
