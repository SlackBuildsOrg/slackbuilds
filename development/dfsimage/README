dfsimage (utility for BBC micro floppy disk images)

dfsimage is a command-line utility and a Python module dedicated to
maintenance of BBC Micro disk image files. These files usually have
extensions .ssd for single sided disk images, or .dsd for double sided
disk images.

dfsimage allows indexing contents of the disk images, importing files
to and exporting from the disk images, and modifying disk images in
place, such as renaming files or changing the disk title.
