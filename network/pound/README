Pound is a reverse proxy, load balancer and HTTPS front-end for
web servers.
It was developed to enable distributing the load among several
servers and to allow for a convenient SSL wrapper for those servers
that do not offer it natively.

By default it is built in a minimal configuration. If you need
advanced features, install the following packages prior to building it:

  adns         DNS-based dynamic backends
  lua	       Lua extensions
  pcre2        Perl-compatible regular expressions

Be sure to edit its configuration file /etc/pound.cfg to your liking.
Detailed documentation about the package is provided both in manpage
(man pound) and in texinfo (info pound) format.
