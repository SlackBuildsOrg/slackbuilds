Email::Address::XS - Parse and format RFC 5322 email addresses and
groups

This module implements RFC 5322 parser and formatter of email addresses
and groups. It parses an input string from email headers which contain
a list of email addresses or a groups of email addresses (like From,
To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...).

Also it can generate a string value for those headers from a list of
email addresses objects.
Module is backward compatible with RFC 2822 and RFC 822.
