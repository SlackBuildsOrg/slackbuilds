Intel(r) Threading Building Blocks (Intel TBB) offers a rich and
complete approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It
is a library that helps you take advantage of multi-core processor
performance without having to be a threading expert. Intel TBB is not
just a threads-replacement library.  It represents a higher-level,
task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading
mechanisms for scalability and performance.
