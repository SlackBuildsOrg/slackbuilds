# 20180909 bkw:
# - Re-enable building with synctex, since texlive has been fixed. This
#   requires a patch, since this version of zathura was written for an
#   older version of texlive.

# 20180903 bkw:
# - Disable building with synctex, since it currently doesn't work due
#   to a bug in the texlive package. Will be re-enabled when the texlive
#   issue is fixed.
# - Really get rid of color output from the Makefile. I know it's cute,
#   but it confuses less when redirecting to a file.

# 20180102 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.3.8. Have to do some fudging to get it to build with
#   Slack 14.2's older glib2: upstream claims they need 2.50, but the
#   only thing they seem to need it for is the --dependency-file option
#   to glib-compile-resources, which turns out to be unneeded.

# 20170711 bkw:
# - BUILD=2
# - Include API docs in package
# - Switch to github URLs since upstream's site has been broken for 3-4
#   days now. Side effect is, it makes it easier for my update script to
#   let me know when there's a new release. This means adding the built
#   man pages to SBo git (otherwise I'd have Sphinx as a dep, yuck).

# 20170125 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.3.7, poppler plugin v0.2.7

# 20160725 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.3.6

# 20150511 bkw:
# - Version bump 0.3.3. The poppler plugin is still on 0.2.5.
# - Make the poppler plugin's pdf.so a symlink. Will do the same
#   for zathura-pdf-mupdf, to allow switching between the two without
#   reinstalling packages. This wouldn't have worked with older versions,
#   due to changes in glib's g_file_test() between glib 1.x and 2.x.
# - Upstream started using -fdiagnostics-color=always, which is only
#   supported in newer gcc versions. Get rid of it.

# Updated 20130617 by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>:
# - Updated for v0.2.3

# Updated 20120721 by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>:
# - Updated for v0.2.0
# - generated man pages now included by upstream, get rid of ours

# Updated 20120312 by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>:
# - Updated for v0.1.1, including poppler plugin
# - Restore missing .desktop file and AUTHORS doc
# - Add an icon
# - Include generated man pages
# - fix homepage URL

# Work around a bug in Slackware's ghostscript.
# http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692891
#
# Supposedly this was fixed, but I'm getting stack traces that look just
# like those. The trouble is, if any of the plugins depends on libgs.so,
# that library gets loaded during zathura's "scan for plugins" phase.
# If libjpeg.so wasn't already loaded, it gets loaded and mangled by
# libgs. This happens *before* zathura knows which plugin matches the file
# we're trying to view. Now, the plugin is chosen based on the file's
# mime type. If said plugin *isn't* the one using libgs, but it *does*
# use libjpeg, *boom* segfault.
#
# What I found is that the postscript plugin uses libsceptre, which uses
# libgs... and the mupdf and comicbook plugins use libjpeg.  The end result
# is that the mupdf and cb plugins crash the first time they try to load
# a jpeg from the pdf/cbr, *but* only if the ps plugin is installed!
# Both plugins work fine if the ps plugin is removed.
#
# I found that 'export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libjpeg.so' stops the
# segfaulting, while not affecting the ps plugin. The patch below is
# basically just the C equivalent: use dlopen() to load libjpeg.so before
# scanning for plugins. Yes, it's a hack, that depends on implementation
# specific details, but the alternative would be to try and talk Pat V
# into patching and rebuilding his ghostscript and/or libsceptre packages,
# which he won't be doing this late in the release cycle (I wouldn't either).

# synctex API in recent texlive has changed from whatever version
# zathura was developed with. This is a monkey patch, with me as
# the monkey: monkey see someone else's patch for something else here:
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?att=1;bug=896566;filename=synctex2;msg=10
# ...and monkey do the same thing to zathura.
# A while after I did this, I found someone else's patch:
# http://pk.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/universe/z/zathura/zathura_0.3.9-2.debian.tar.xz
# ...the portion of the patch that alters synctex.c looks identical to
# the one I came up with, meaning I could have saved myself some work...
