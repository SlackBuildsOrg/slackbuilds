Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It is meant to be used for
editing maps of any tile-based game, be it an RPG, a platformer or a
Breakout clone.

Tiled is very flexible, for example there are no restrictions on map
size, tile size or the number of layers or tiles. Also, it allows
arbitrary properties to be set on the map, its layers, the tiles or on
the objects. Its map format (TMX) is relatively easy to understand and
allows a map to use multiple tilesets while also allowing each tileset
to grow or shrink as necessary later.
