SQLAlchemy-legacy (The Python SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper)

SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper
that gives application developers the full power and
flexibility of SQL.

This builds the legacy 1.4 version of SQLAlchemy, for packages which
can't yet work with SQLAlchemy 2.
Those of which are currently limited to buildbot.

Beware that SQLAlchemy-legacy and SQLAlchemy conflicts and can't be
installed at the same time!
However most packages using SQLAlchemy-2 may work with SQLAlchemy-legacy
hence this could be a proper fallback, if needed.
