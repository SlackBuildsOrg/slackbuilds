Provides library functionality for communicating with a FIDO device
over USB as well as verifying attestation and assertion signatures.

This library aims to support the FIDO U2F and FIDO 2 protocols for
communicating with a USB authenticator via the Client-to-Authenticator
Protocol (CTAP 1 and 2). In addition to this low-level device access,
classes defined in the fido2.client and fido2.server modules implement
higher level operations which are useful when interfacing with
an Authenticator, or when implementing WebAuthn support for a Relying
Party.

pyscard is an optional dependency.

Version 1.2.0 is the last version supported by Slackware 15. Version
2.0.0 and newer require Python 3.10+, while Slackware 15 only has
Python 3.9.
