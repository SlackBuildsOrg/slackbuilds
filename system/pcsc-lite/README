PC/SC-lite is a middleware to access a smart card using SCard API
(PC/SC) Its purpose is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in a
very small form factor for communicating to smart cards and readers.

Compiling with "DEBUGATR=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild" enables ATR parsing
debug output messages.

On-demand power on (auto power off) feature for an inserted card is
disabled, now. If you want it re-enabled, so the card is powered off
after a few seconds of inactivity (upstream's default since version
1.6.5) you can compile with "AUTOPOFF=1 ./pcsc-lite.SlackBuild".

pcsc-lite no longer uses (deprecated) libhal for smart-card reader's
detection. By default libudev is used now.

You need to add a user pcscd (257) and a group pcscd (257).

Please see README.SLACKWARE in pcsc-lite's documentation directory
for notes.
