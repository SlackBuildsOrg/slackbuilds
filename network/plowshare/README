Plowshare is a set of command-line tools (written entirely in Bash shell
script) designed for managing file-sharing websites (aka Hosters).

Plowshare itself doesn't support any websites. It's just the
core engine. Support for websites are added via modules. They are
available separately and it's recommended to be installed by the user
rather than system-wide. It can be installed/updated by the user to
~/.config/plowshare/modules.d/ directory using:

$ plowmod --install
$ plowmod --update

However, if you'd like them system-wide, please see the
plowshare-modules SBo package. Modules will be installed to
/usr/share/plowshare/modules/

Per INSTALL, either rhino or sunspider (the latter is not available on
SBo) are optional runtime dependencies. It is stated they are required
for some sites. However, I have not come across any that didn't
work. Let me know if it should become a required dependency.
