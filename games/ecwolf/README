ecwolf (an advanced source port for Wolfenstein 3D)

ECWolf is an advanced source port for Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny,
and Super 3D Noah's Ark based off of the Wolf4SDL code base. ECWolf
pulls a substantial amount of code from ZDoom and aims to provide a wide
array of mod editing capabilities without the need to modify the source
code. Most importantly you will no longer need to replace entire data
sets. With ECWolf you could for example add a weapon without needing to
distribute every sprite in the game along with it. Mods will be neatly
packaged into a single file just like they are for Doom.

For players, ECWolf provides many useful features such as better
control binding, support for wide screen resolutions, and unlimited
save slots. ECWolf allows you to keep all of your game data in one
directory as one binary plays all supported games. Support for even
more Wolfenstein engine games is planned for the one binary plays all
supported games. Support for even more Wolfenstein engine games is
planned for the binary plays all supported games. Support for even more
Wolfenstein engine games is planned for the future! (I know you're all
waiting for Blake Stone support.)  In terms of accuracy to vanilla Wolf,
it is about the same as the accuracy of ZDoom to vanilla Doom.

To play ECWolf the game date will be required, it can be placed in:
  /usr/share/games/wolf3d
