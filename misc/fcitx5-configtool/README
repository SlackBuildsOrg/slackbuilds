Fcitx5-configtool provides the configuration GUI for Fcitx5.

Do note that although this package could be installed along with the 
bundled kcm-fcitx, they are considered conflicting packages in some
other distros (like Arch), so depending on your situation, you may
uninstall and blacklist kcm-fcitx before installing this package.

Building with Qt6 is turned off by default. If you want to use the
Qt6 version, simply change -DUSE_QT6=Off into -DUSE_QT6=On in the
SlackBuild.
