Calibre is meant to be a complete e-library solution. It includes
library management, format conversion, news feeds to ebook conversion
as well as e-book reader sync features.

Calibre is primarily an ebook cataloging program. It manages your
ebook collection for you. It is designed around the concept of the
logical book, i.e. a single entry in the database that may correspond
to ebooks in several formats. It also supports conversion from a dozen
different ebook formats to LRF and EPUB. A graphical interface to
the conversion software can be accessed easily by just clicking the
"Convert E-books" button.
