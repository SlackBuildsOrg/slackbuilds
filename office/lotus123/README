lotus123 (Lotus 1-2-3 for Linux)

This is a native port of Lotus 1-2-3 Release 3 to Linux.
There's an article documenting how this is possible here:
https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/linux123.html

The executable and man page are called "123", since this is the
traditional name for Lotus 1-2-3 on UNIX. The keyedit(1) and
setup123(1) commands mentioned in the man page have not been
ported yet.

This software hasn't been maintained in 30 years, so it's a good idea
to *never* run it as root.

Since this is based on a binary i386 release of 1-2-3, it only builds
on 32-bit x86. You *might* be able to build in on x86_64 if you have
AlienBOB's multilib packages installed, but the SlackBuild author
hasn't tested this. If it won't build on multilib, you can still build
it on a 32-bit Slackware system, then install the package on multilib
(it should run just fine).

This will *not* build on ARM or any other non-x86 CPU.
