xtrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Unix and
the X Window system. It includes lower case, the real time clock,
hi-res graphics, serial port, parallel printer, mouse, cassette,
sound and music output (requires OSS), 5" and 8" floppy disk drives in
single and double density, and even hard disk drives.

To run xtrs, you will need a 'romfile' with the contents of the
original ROM of the model you want to emulate. Since these are
copyrighted, they are not included in this package. However, do not
despair! The xtrs page explains how to obtain a legal copy of the
MODELA/III file that can be used. These or other ROM images should be
copied to the /usr/share/xtrs directory.

A simple xtrs.desktop file is included that will start xtrs with the
default options. Read the included 'xtrs' man page after installation
for more information and command-line options.
