MKVToolnix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska
(and WebM) files. With these tools one can:

  * Get information about Matroska files (mkvinfo)
  * Extract tracks/data from Matroska files (mkvextract)
  * Create Matroska files from other media files (mkvmerge)
  * Modify properties of existing Matroska files (mkvpropedit)

The script will build QT GUI by default. It can be disabled by GUI=no

It is also possible to install translation of man pages. It requires
po4a to be installed. Configure catches it automatically.

Below libraries are bundled with the source code and configure will use
system version if they are usable:
  * avilib
  * librmff
  * nlohmann-json
  * pugixml (on SBo)
  * utf8-cpp
  * fmt (on SBo)
  * libebml (on SBo)
  * libmatroska (on SBo)

Installation of the above libraries are completely optional and internal
versions are well tested within the application.
