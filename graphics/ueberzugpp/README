ueberzugpp (drop in replacement for ueberzug written in C++)

Ueberzug++ is a command line utility written in C++ which allows to
draw images on terminals by using X11/wayland child windows, sixels,
kitty and iterm2 protocols or chafa.

This project intends to be a drop-in replacement for the now
defunct ueberzug project (https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug).

Options:
  * WAYLAND=yes -- enable support for wayland (window positioning is
                   correct only for sway and hyprland)

NOTE: Do not install at the same time with "ueberzug" package!
      Both provide /usr/bin/ueberzug.
