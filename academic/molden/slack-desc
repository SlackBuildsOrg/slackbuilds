# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

f2c: Molden pre- and post processing of molecular and electronic structure
f2c:
f2c: by G.Schaftenaar, Theoretical & Computational Chemistry group
f2c:
f2c: Molden is a package for displaying Molecular Density from the Ab
f2c: Initio packages GAMESS-UK, GAMESS-US, GAUSSIAN, ADF, and the Semi-
f2c: Empirical packages Mopac/Ampac, it also supports a number of other
f2c: programs via the Molden Format. Molden reads all the required input
f2c: information from the GAMESS / GAUSSIAN outputfile. Molden is capable
f2c: of displaying Molecular Orbitals, the electron density and the
f2c: Molecular minus atomic density.
