libisoburn is a frontend for libraries libburn and libisofs
which enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on
all CD/DVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like
DVD+RW, which do not support multi-session management on media level
and even plain disk files or block devices. The price for that is
thorough specialization on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images,
so libisoburn is not suitable for audio (CD-DA) or any other CD layout
which does not entirely consist of ISO-9660 sessions. There is a
command line and dialog application xorriso which allows to use large
parts of libisoburn's feature set.
