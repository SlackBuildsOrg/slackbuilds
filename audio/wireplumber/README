Wireplumber - Session / policy manager implementation for PipeWire

WirePlumber is a modular session / policy manager for PipeWire and a
GObject-based high-level library that wraps PipeWire’s API,
providing convenience for writing the daemon’s modules as well as
external tools for managing PipeWire.

The WirePlumber daemon implements the session & policy management
service. It follows a modular design, having plugins that implement
the actual management functionality.

The WirePlumber Library provides API that allows you to extend the
WirePlumber daemon, to write management or status tools for PipeWire
(apps that don’t do actual media streaming) and to write custom
session managers for embedded devices.


Replacement of pipewire-media :
Based on what P. Volkerding did for pulseaudio/pipewire
There are 2 scripts to enable/disable wireplumber, in /usr/sbin :
- wireplumber-enable.sh
- wireplumber-disable.sh
