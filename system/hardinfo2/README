hardinfo2 (hardware information tool)

hardinfo2 offers system information and benchmarking for Linux
systems. It is able to obtain information from both hardware and basic
software. It can benchmark your system and compare to other machines
online.

sysbench is an optional dependency (highly recommended). It's used
for benchmarking, not for hardware identification, and it's a runtime
dependency (can be installed later, without rebuilding hardinfo2).
