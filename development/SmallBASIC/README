SmallBASIC is a fast and easy to learn BASIC language interpreter
ideal for everyday calculations, scripts and prototypes. SmallBASIC
includes trigonometric, matrices and algebra functions, a built in
IDE, a powerful string library, system, sound, graphic commands and
communication via serial or sockets along with structured
programming syntax.

SmallBASIC is available for various operating systems, including
Windows, Linux, and Android. You can even build it from source to
run on many other POSIX-compliant systems, such as Raspberry Pi OS
for the Raspberry Pi. With its built-in Integrated Development
Environment (IDE), you can write programs on your Android-powered
tablet or mobile phone and run them instantly.
If you want to get started, you can download SmallBASIC from our
Downloads page.

SmallBASIC makes it easy to bundle your program with all the
necessary libraries, creating executable files for Windows
(exe-files) or Linux (AppImage).
For Android, you can create a signed package (pkg) and
distribute it through platforms like Google Play. Learn more
about distributing your program on our (Distribution) page.

If you prefer an online experience, you can start programming
with the web-based version of SmallBASIC in your browser right now.
