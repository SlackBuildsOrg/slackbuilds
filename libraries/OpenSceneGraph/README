The OpenSceneGraph is an open source cross platform graphics toolkit
for the development of high performance graphics applications
such as flight simulators, games, virtual reality and scientific
visualization.  Based around the concept of a scene graph, it provides
an object oriented framework on top of OpenGL freeing the developer
from implementing and optimizing low level graphics calls, and
provides many additional utilities for rapid development of graphics
applications.

Plugins will be automatically generated using the following optional
packages if they are detected at build time:

  dcmtk, ffmpeg, gdal, gtkglext, libgta, libLAS, nvidia-texture-tools,
  fltk, SDL2, wxGTK3

These plugins offer significant additional functionality and are
recommended for building a fully featured OpenSceneGraph.
