ToME-ah (AnonymousHero's ToME fork) is a game that emphasizes
intricate, challenging, and varied gameplay over graphics. Hundreds
of different monsters in randomly-generated, unpredictable dungeons
will strive to slay you by various means, and you counter - if you
survive - by developing the skills of your choice and wielding mighty
artifacts.

You can install ToME-SX alongside other ToME 2 forks, but must back
up, delete save folder (~/.tome) between different games.
