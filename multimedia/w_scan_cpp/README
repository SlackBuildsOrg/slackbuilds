w_scan_cpp is a dtv channel scanner based on VDR and it's Plugins.

It uses (and therefore links to and includes part of)
   1. VDR Plugin framework
      https://www.tvdr.de
   2. VDR satip Plugin
      https://github.com/rofafor/vdr-plugin-satip
   3. VDR wirbelscan Plugin
      https://www.gen2vdr.de/wirbel/wirbelscan/index2.html
   4. librepfunc
      https://github.com/wirbel-at-vdr-portal/librepfunc

adds optional LCN to channel names (channels.conf: mplayer/vdr/xine)
LCN=yes ./w_scan_cpp.SlackBuild
so that, if you want the channels sorted by LCN, you can run
w_scan_cpp -c IT -X | sort > channels.conf
