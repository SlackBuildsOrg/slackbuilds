bottom (system/process monitor for the terminal)

bottom is a configurable, widget-based system and process monitor for
the terminal.

Completions are installed for bash and zsh by default, and for fish if
fish is installed at the time of building. PowerShell completions can
be enabled by adding ". _btm.ps1" to the profile. _btm.ps1 and btm.fish
can be found in the doc directory.

A default configuration file is generated at
$HOME/.config/bottom/bottom.toml when running for the first time.
