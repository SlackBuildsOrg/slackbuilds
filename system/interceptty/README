interceptty is designed to sit between a serial port (or other terminal
device, or program, or socket, or something connected to a file descri-
ptor) and a program which is communicating with that device, recording
everything that goes back and forth between the two. It does this by o-
pening the real device, creating a pseudo-tty, then forwarding everyth-
ing between the two, recording whatever it sees. It has a number of op-
tions that let you fine-tune the devices it uses and the terminal opti-
ons for the real device.
