ZX BASIC is a BASIC "cross compiler". It will compile BASIC
programs (in your PC) for your ZX Spectrum. ZX BASIC is an
SDK entirely written in python. The SDK is implemented using
the PLY (Python Lex/Yacc) compiler tool. It translates BASIC
to Z80 assembler code, so it is easily portable to other Z80
platforms (Amstrad, MSX). Other non Z80 targets could also
be available in the future.

ZX BASIC syntax tries to maintain compatibility as much as
possible with Sinclair BASIC, it also have many new features,
mostly taken from FreeBASIC dialect.

ZX Basic is also know as "Boriel Basic" in reference to its
creator, Jose Rodriguez-Rosa Boriel.
