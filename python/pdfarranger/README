PDF Arranger is a small python-gtk application, which helps the user
to merge or split pdf documents and rotate, crop and rearrange their
pages using an interactive and intuitive graphical interface. It is
a frontend for pikepdf and a fork of Konstantinos Poulios's
pdfshuffler.

PDF Arranger supports image file import if img2pdf is installed
