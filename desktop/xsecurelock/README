XSecureLock is an X11 screen lock utility designed with the primary goal
of security.

Screen lock utilities are widespread. However, in the past they often
had security issues regarding authentication bypass (a crashing screen
locker would unlock the screen), information disclosure (notifications
may appear on top of the screen saver), or sometimes even worse.

In XSecureLock, security is achieved using a modular design to avoid the
usual pitfalls of screen locking utility design on X11.

If pandoc (or pandoc-bin) is installed, then the SlackBuild will build
man pages as well.

In addition, mpv provides support for the saver_mpv module (which plays
video clips in $HOME/Videos).
