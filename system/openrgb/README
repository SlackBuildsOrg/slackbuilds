openrgb (Open source RGB lighting control)

What if there was a way to control all of your RGB devices from
a single app, on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, without any nonsense?
That is what OpenRGB sets out to achieve.  One app to rule them all.

NOTE: OpenRGB requires access to the I2C system through the i2c-dev
module and an additional i2c module for your motherboard, usually
i2c-piix4 for AMD systems and i2c-i801 for Intel systems. If these
modules are not loaded (check using `lsmod | grep i2c`), add any
unloaded, required modules to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local

/sbin/modprobe i2c_dev    # For all systems
/sbin/modprobe i2c_piix4  # For AMD systems
/sbin/modprobe i2c_i801   # For Intel systems

If there is a desire to support the server/client setup with an
automatic start on boot, please let me know (patches would most
certainly be welcome as it isn't my current use case).
