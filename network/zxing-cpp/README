ZXing-C++ ("zebra crossing") is an open-source, multi-format
linear/matrix barcode image processing library implemented in C++.

It was originally ported from the Java ZXing Library but has been
developed further and now includes many improvements in terms of
runtime and detection performance. It can both read and write
barcodes in a number of formats.

Features:
 * Written in pure C++17 (/C++20), no third-party dependencies
   (for the library itself)
 * Thread safe
 * Wrappers/Bindings for:
    - Android
    - C
    - iOS
    - Python
    - WebAssembly
    - WinRT
    - Flutter (external project)
