# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

scrypt: scrypt (scrypt encryption utility and library)
scrypt:
scrypt: The scrypt key derivation function was originally developed for use in
scrypt: the Tarsnap online backup system and is designed to be far more secure
scrypt: against hardware brute-force attacks than alternative functions such
scrypt: as PBKDF2 or bcrypt. A simple password-based encryption utility and an
scrypt: optional library are available as a demonstration of the scrypt key
scrypt: derivation function.
