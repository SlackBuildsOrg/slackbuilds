# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pari-seadata: pari-seadata
pari-seadata:
pari-seadata: Needed by ellap and ellcard for large primes. Require PARI/GP
pari-seadata: 2.4.3 and up. These polynomials were extracted from the
pari-seadata: ECHIDNA databases and computed by David R. Kohel.
pari-seadata: This covers finite fields of cardinality q up to 750 bits.
pari-seadata: PARI/GP 2.9 contains fallback code to go on when all modular
pari-seadata: polynomials in thedatabase have been exhausted and can handle
pari-seadata: larger fields (with an important slowdown).
