sngrep is a tool for displaying SIP calls message flows from terminal.

It supports live capture to display realtime SIP packets and can also 
be used as PCAP viewer.

The following options are available for compilation:

ENABLE_IPV6: Default is yes, adds IPv6 support.  Setting this
  variable to any value other than yes will disable IPv6 support.

OPENSSL_TLS: Default is yes, uses OpenSSL for TLS support.  Setting
  this variable to any value other than yes results in gnutls being
  used instead for TLS support.

PCRE2: Default is yes, uses pcre2 for regex support.  Setting this
  variable to any value other than yes results in the use of pcre
  instead for regex support.
