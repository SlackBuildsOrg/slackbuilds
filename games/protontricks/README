This is a wrapper script that allows you to easily run Winetricks 
commands for Steam Play/Proton games among other common Wine features, 
such as launching external Windows executables. 

This is often useful when a game requires closed-source runtime 
libraries or applications that are not included with
Proton.

Optional GUI support requires installing one of the following runtime
dependencies:

desktop/yad (recommended by upstream)
desktop/zenity

If both yad and zenity are installed, yad will be used when launching
protontricks unless overriden by the PROTONTRICKS_GUI=zenity
environment variable when launching.
