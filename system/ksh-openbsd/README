This package is a patched version of the OpenBSD ksh ported to Linux,
which is based on the original PD-ksh, but heavily modified and
maintained by OpenBSD developers.

"Patched" means it contains modifications outside of the OpenBSD tree
(and besides the Linux port bits).

See the Changelog.ksh-openbsd and the homepage for more information
about the changes: https://github.com/levaidaniel/ksh-openbsd

There's a build option (PDKSH_BINNAME) to change the binary and manual
names during build.
