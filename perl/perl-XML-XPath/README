XML::XPath - a set of modules for parsing and evaluating XPath
statements.

DESCRIPTION
    This module aims to comply exactly to the XPath specification at
    http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath and yet allow extensions to be added
    in the form of functions. Modules such as XSLT and XPointer may
    need to do this as they support functionality beyond XPath.
