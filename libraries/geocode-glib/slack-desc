# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

geocode-glib: geocode-glib (convenience library for the geocoding)
geocode-glib:
geocode-glib: geocode-glib is a convenience library for the geocoding (finding
geocode-glib: longitude, and latitude from an address) and reverse geocoding
geocode-glib: (finding an address from coordinates). It uses Nominatim service to
geocode-glib: achieve that. It also caches (reverse-)geocoding requests for faster
geocode-glib: results and to avoid unnecessary server load.
