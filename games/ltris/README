ltris (tetris clone)

LTris as a tetris clone which means you have a bowl with blocks
falling down. By rotating and moving the blocks, you try to
to assemble whole lines, which then disappear.

Note: the game has been slightly patched: the default is now windowed
mode, rather than fullscreen. This is because it doesn't work properly
on multi-head systems (at least, not the SlackBuild maintainer's). If
you enable fullscreen and the program locks up your X server, press
Ctrl-Alt-Backspace to get out of X, log in again, and run "rm -rf
~/.local/share/ltris2" to restore the default settings before running
ltris again.
