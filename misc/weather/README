This command-line utility is intended to provide quick access to
current weather conditions and forecasts.  Presently, it is capable
of returning data for localities throughout the USA by retrieving
and formatting decoded METARs (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports)
from NOAA (the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)
and forecasts from NWS (the USA National Weather Service).  The tool
is written to function in the same spirit as other command-line
informational utilities like cal(1), calendar(1) and dict(1).  It can
retrieve arbitrary weather data via specific command-line switches
(station ID, city, state), or aliases can be configured system wide
and on a per-user basis.  It can be freely used and redistributed
under the terms of a BSD-like License.

*SPECIAL NOTE*

This will copy the existing "/usr/bin/weather" script on the
system (which is part of the "expect" package in Slackware) to
"/usr/bin/weather.expect" while installing the one in this package
as "/usr/bin/weather.weather" and creating a symlink to it from
/usr/bin/weather.  If you remove this package later for whatever
reason, then you will need to either reinstall Slackware's "expect"
package, fix the symlink, or remove the symlink and rename the
"/usr/bin/weather.expect" file back to "/usr/bin/weather"
