Schedtool interfaces with the Linux CPU scheduler.

It allows the user to set and query the CPU-affinity and nice-levels
of processes, as well as all scheduling policies, like batch or
real-time (RR/FIFO) classes and their priorities. It can be used to
avoid skipping for A/V-applications, to lock processes onto certain
CPUs on SMP/NUMA systems, or to adjust nice-levels of lesser important
jobs to maintain a high amount of interactive responsiveness under
high load.

All special scheduling classes of the -ck kernel patchset are also
supported.

Certain modes (as of this writing: SCHED_IDLEPRIO and SCHED_ISO) need a
patched kernel; see the INSTALL file for details.
