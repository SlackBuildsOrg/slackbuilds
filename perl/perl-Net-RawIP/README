Net::RawIP - Perl extension to manipulate raw IP packets with
interface to libpcap.

This package provides a class which can be used for creating,
manipulating and sending raw IP packets with optional features for
manipulating Ethernet headers.

As its name implies, this module is quite low-level, and currently
duplicates some features with Net::Pcap. If you prefer a higher-level
module (in terms of Perl support), please take a look at Net::Write,
which provides a portable interface to construct and send raw packets
on the network.
