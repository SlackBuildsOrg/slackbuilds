TLP implements advanced power management for Linux.

It is a command line tool with automated background tasks,
does not contain a GUI.

Remove any power saving settings/scripts (e.g.: in /etc/rc.local),
and uninstall laptop-mode-tools prior installing or TLP may not work
properly.

See README.SLACKWARE for more information about post-installation
script.

An additional configuration is available for Thinkpads. See the
website for more details:
