# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-scikit-build-core: python3-scikit-build-core (Build backend for CMake based projects)
python3-scikit-build-core:
python3-scikit-build-core: Scikit-build-core is a build backend for Python that uses CMake
python3-scikit-build-core: to build extension modules. It has a simple yet powerful static
python3-scikit-build-core: configuration system in pyproject.toml, and supports almost unlimited
python3-scikit-build-core: flexibility via CMake. It was initially developed to support the
python3-scikit-build-core: demanding needs of scientific users, but can build any sort of
python3-scikit-build-core: package that uses CMake.
python3-scikit-build-core:
python3-scikit-build-core: Scikit-build-core is a ground-up rewrite of the classic Scikit-build
