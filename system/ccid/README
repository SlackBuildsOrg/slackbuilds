libccid provides a PC/SC IFD handler implementation for the USB
smart card drivers compliant to the Chip Card Interface Device (CCID)
protocol.

This package is needed to communicate with the CCID smartcard readers
through the PC/SC Lite resource manager (pcscd). It also supports
various Gemplus serial smart card readers.

You will need to edit the pcsc-lite config files to be able to use
serial smart card readers. The INSTALL file in the documentation
directory has all the details.
