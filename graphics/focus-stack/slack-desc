# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

focus-stack: focus-stack (Fast and easy focus stacking)
focus-stack:
focus-stack: focus-stack takes a set of photos taken at different focus settings
focus-stack: and combines them into one, selecting the sharpest source image for
focus-stack: each pixel position. This is commonly called extended depth of field,
focus-stack: or focus stacking. Typical use is for microscope photography where it
focus-stack: is difficult to obtain large enough depth of field to cover the whole
focus-stack: subject. This application uses OpenCV library and its OpenCL
focus-stack: acceleration interface.
