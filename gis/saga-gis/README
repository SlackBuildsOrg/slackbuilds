System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) is a Geographic
System Information software with immense capabilities for geodata
System processing and analysis.

SAGA supports the implementation of new functions with an effective
API.  Functions are organised as modules in framework independent
Module Libraries and can be accessed via SAGA's Graphical User
Interface or various scripting environments (shell scripts, Python,
R and so on).

SAGA can use these optional dependencies: libharu, liblas, postgresql
and qhull. SAGA currently does not build when vigra is installed.

To enable opencv, set OPENCV=ON. By default OpenCV is disabled since
SAGA does not build when opencv version 4 or greater is installed. For
a compatible version of OpenCV, use the opencv-legacy SlackBuild.

If SAGA fails to run after an upgrade, uninstall old versions of SAGA
before compilation.
