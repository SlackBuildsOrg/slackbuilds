ecm-tools (encoder/decoder for error code modeler CD/DVD compression)

ECM is a compression format for ".bin" CD/DVD images, typically used
to distribute Playstation ROMs.

This is a fork of the original ECM, primarily to host the code because
upstream seems dead, with a minor change to how binaries are named to
avoid conflicts with Sage Mathematics' ECM.

The commands are "ecm2bin" and "bin2ecm". There are no man pages, but
you can run the commands with no arguments to see the built-in help
messages.
