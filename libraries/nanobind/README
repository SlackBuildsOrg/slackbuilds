nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in Python
and vice versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and pybind11 and
uses near-identical syntax. In contrast to these existing tools,
nanobind is more efficient: bindings compile in a shorter amount of
time, produce smaller binaries, and have better runtime performance.

More concretely, benchmarks show up to ~4× faster compile time,
~5× smaller binaries, and ~10× lower runtime overheads compared to
pybind11. nanobind also outperforms Cython in important metrics
(3-12× binary size reduction, 1.6-4× compilation time reduction,
similar runtime performance).
