Sdorfehs (pronounced "starfish") is a tiling window manager that
descended from ratpoison. Like ratpoison, sdorfehs divides the screen
into one or more frames. Sdorfehs uses a prefix key that proceeds most
bindings like GNU Screen. This prefix is set to Control+a (refered to
as C-a in the configuration).

Use Slackware's 'xwmconfig' terminal UI command to switch to sdorfehs
and then run 'startx'. Press Control+a and then ? (question mark) to
view a list of key bindings.
