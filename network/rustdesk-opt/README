RustDesk is a remote access and remote control software, that enables
remote maintenance of computers and other devices.

RustDesk is an open-source alternative to remote desktop software such
as TeamViewer. It can function without relying on additional tools
such as VPNs or port forwarding, even behind firewalls or NATs.

This SlackBuild only works on the x86_64 architecture because the file
libsciter-gtk.so was compiled for this architecture. It is also
available for ARM32 and ARM64 but has not been tested. If someone
manages to get it working on other architectures, they can inform the
maintainer.

Note: The source files below ending with -deps.tar.gz are optional.
They contain cache files and dependencies that enable offline building.
If they are not present when you run the SlackBuild, the necessary
files will be automatically downloaded from the internet.

This script installs RustDesk into /opt.
