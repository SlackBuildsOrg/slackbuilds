Cataclysm:DDA is a turn-based survival-themed roguelike game set in a
post-apocalyptic world. You awaken with hazy memories of violence and
terror from when the world suddenly unravelled around you. Now you
need to explore your surroundings, and secure food, water and safety.

This SlackBuild downloads the latest official Linux curses build,
which is only available for the x86-64 architecture.

This script modifies the launcher to store game data in `$HOME/.cdda`
and also includes some fixes without which the game would not launch:
 - symlink `/usr/lib64/libtinfo.so.5` => `/usr/lib64/libtinfo.so.6`
 - override of env. variable TERM to work with graphical terminal
   emulators
