# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

iwd:
iwd: iNet Wireless Daemon (iwd) project aims to provide a comprehensive
iwd: Wi-Fi connectivity solution for Linux based devices. The core goal of
iwd: the project is to optimize resource utilization: storage, runtime
iwd: memory and link-time costs. This is accomplished by not depending on
iwd: any external libraries and utilizes features provided by the Linux
iwd: kernel to the maximum extent possible. The result is a self-contained
iwd: environment that only depends on the Linux kernel and the runtime C
iwd: library.
