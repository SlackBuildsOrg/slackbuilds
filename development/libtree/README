libtree prints the shared libraries required by each program or shared
library on the command line as a tree. By default certain common system
libraries are hidden to prune the tree.

Unlike "ldd", libtree only parses the binary and does not use dynamic
loader to load them to memory. Therefore, it is a safer approach to
analyse suspicious binaries.

A static build is recommended by the upstream. One can build the tool
statically by passing STATIC=yes:

# STATIC=yes sh libtree.SlackBuild

The patch included in this package is already upstream, but hasn't
ended up in a release yet. It's mainly targeted for the future
15.1 release and the "current".
