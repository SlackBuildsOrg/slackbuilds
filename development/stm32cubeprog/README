STM32CubeProgrammer (STM32CubeProg) is an all-in-one multi-OS software
tool for programming STM32 products.

It provides an easy-to-use and efficient environment for reading,
writing, and verifying device memory through both the debug interface
(JTAG and SWD) and the bootloader interface (UART and USB DFU, I2C, SPI,
and CAN).

STM32CubeProgrammer offers a wide range of features to program STM32
internal memories (such as flash, RAM, and OTP) as well as external
memories.

STM32CubeProgrammer also allows option programming and upload,
programming content verification, and programming automation through
scripting.

NOTE:

- The source tarball has to be downloaded manually from the website.
  Choose STM32CubePrg-Lin package.
- 7zip and zulu-openjdk* are only used for repackaging the upstream
  tarball and are not used during the run-time. Different version
  of JDK _might_ work as well (not tested.)
