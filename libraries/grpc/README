gRPC is a modern, open source, high-performance remote procedure call
(RPC) framework that can run anywhere. gRPC enables client and server
applications to communicate transparently, and simplifies the building
of connected systems.

This SlackBuild builds gRPC in C++. python3-grpcio contains the Python 3
build of gRPC.
