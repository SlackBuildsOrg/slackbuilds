BRL-CAD is a powerful cross-platform open source solid modeling
system that includes interactive geometry editing, high-performance
ray-tracing for rendering and geometric analysis, image and
signal-processing tools, a system performance analysis benchmark
suite, libraries for robust geometric representation, with more than
20 years of active development.

Optional dependencies: astyle, proj, gdal. BRL-CAD will use them
if available; if not it will use bundled versions. gdal is used by
BRL-CAD but it does not detect the SBo version and always uses bundled
one.

Also there are a few options. Usage:
  OPTION=ON/OFF sh ./brlcad.SlackBuild

* BRLCAD_ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG=ON
Enables support for application and library debugging facilities.
Disabling the run-time debugging facilities can provide a significant
(10%-30%) performance boost at the expense of extensive error
checking (that in turn help prevent corruption of your data).
Default is "ON", and should only be disabled for read-only render
work where performance is critical.

WARNING: None of the options below seems to actually complete the build

* BRLCAD_ENABLE_QT=OFF
Uses qt instead of TCL/Tk.
Default value is OFF, BRL-CAD does not autodetect qt presence.

* BRLCAD_ENABLE_OSG=OFF
Uses OpenSceneGraph based optional features.
Requires that the OpenSceneGraph package is installed.
Default value is OFF, BRL-CAD does not autodetect OSG presence.

* BRLCAD_ENABLE_RTGL=OFF
Enable experimental RTGL code.
Default value is OFF, it is experimental.
