Bcachefs is a modern copy-on-write filesystem for Linux offering 
advanced features like snapshots, checksumming, compression, 
and encryption with improved performance.

This package provides userspace utilities for bcachefs management.
The userspace tools require bcachefs support in the kernel (or
as a kernel module).  Refer to the bcachefs-kernel-dkms script on 
Slackbuilds to build the associated kernel module.

Bcachefs userspace tools require libblkid and blkid versions that
are newer than that available in Slackware 15.0.  The build script 
handles this by temporarily compiling libblkid for static linking 
without installing it system-wide.

The script will also install an updated blkid binary as 
/sbin/blkid.bcachefs to provide the functionality needed by 
bcachefs-tools without conflicting with the system blkid.

If you are running Slackware-current or have a custom setup with
util-linux >= 2.40.1 installed, you can skip building libblkid 
blkid and by setting NEW_UTIL_LINUX as follows:

NEW_UTIL_LINUX=yes ./bcachefs-tools.SlackBuild
