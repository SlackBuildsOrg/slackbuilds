EditorConfig makes it easy to maintain the correct coding style when
switching between different text editors and between different projects.

The EditorConfig project maintains a file format and plugins for various
text editors which allow this file format to be read and used by those
editors. For information on the file format and supported text editors,
see the EditorConfig website.

Note:
This package is in conflict with python3-editorconfig, which install an
executable of 'editorconfig' into /usr/bin. Please use either one but not both.
