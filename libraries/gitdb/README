Git Object Database.

GitDB is a pure-Python git object database.

GitDB allows you to access bare git repositories for reading and
writing. It aims at allowing full access to loose objects as well
as packs with performance and scalability in mind. It operates
exclusively on streams, allowing to operate on large objects with a
small memory footprint.
