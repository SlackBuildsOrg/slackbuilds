Volatility Framework - Volatile memory extraction utility framework.

Volatility is the world's most widely used framework for extracting 
digit artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction 
techniques are performed completely independent of the system being 
investigated but offer visibility into the runtime state of the system.
The framework is intended to introduce people to the techniques and 
complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts from volatile
memory samples and provide a platform for further work into this 
exciting area of research.

In 2019, the Volatility Foundation released a complete rewrite of the
framework, Volatility3.
