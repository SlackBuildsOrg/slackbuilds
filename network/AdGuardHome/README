AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking.
It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black
hole", thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.

Key features of AdGuard Home:

* Blocking ads and trackers
* Customizing blocklists
* Built-in DHCP server
* HTTPS for the Admin interface
* Encrypted DNS upstream servers: DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, DNSCrypt
* Running as a DNS-over-HTTPS or DNS-over-TLS server
* Blocking phishing and malware domains
* Parental control (blocking adult domains)
* Force Safe search on search engines
* Per-client (device) configuration
* Access settings

A simple init script /etc/rc.d/rc.AdGuardHome has been provided to run
AdGuard Home as a daemon.

In most cases, AdGuard Home should not be run as root. If there exists
the user dnsproxy, the script /etc/rc.d/rc.AdGuardHome will run
AdGuardHome as the user dnsproxy. This user can be created with:
  groupadd -g 384 dnsproxy
  useradd -u 384 -g 384 -s /sbin/nologin -M dnsproxy

If the user dnsproxy does not exist, then the script
/etc/rc.d/rc.AdGuardHome will run dnsproxy as root.

Also, the script /etc/rc.d/rc.AdGuardHome assumes that the configuration
file location is /etc/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml
