Valkey is an advanced key-value store.
It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values
can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and
ordered sets.
These data types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop
elements, add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection,
difference between sets, and so forth.
Valkey supports different kinds of sorting abilities.

Valkey is a fork of Redis after licence went proprietary.

Default port for starting the instance can be set with
VALKEY_PORT=16379
Defaults remains the Redis port at 6379, hence making it incompatible
out-of-the-package with a parallel Redis instance running.

valkey-cli is (for now) fully compatible with redis-cli, and defaults
to redis port 6379.

Valkey still uses, by default, redis binary names, but this script
replaces them with valkey names: valkey-server, valkey-cli and
valkey-benchmark, for having it installed alongside Redis.
Data are also moved to /var/lib/valkey
This can be reversed by setting the VALKEY_BIN environment variable to
anything but ON.
Logs will always be in /var/log/valkey, and RC script is always
/etc/rc.d/rc.valkey
