The SvxLink Server is a general purpose voice services system,
which when connected to a transceiver, can act as both an advanced
repeater system and can also operate on a simplex channel. One could
call it a radio operating system since it sits between the hardware
(transceiver) and the applications (modules) and handle basic system
services as well as input and output.

SvxLink is very extensible and modular. Voice services are implemented
as modules which are isolated from each other. Modules can be
implemented in either C++ or TCL.

The project also includes Qtel, the Qt EchoLink client, is a graphical
application used to access the EchoLink network.

This release includes a new revision of the SvxReflector application,
which is meant to be used as a center point to link SvxLink nodes
together.

You can build only the server by passing QTEL=NO to the script:
QTEL=NO ./svxlink.SlackBuild

Opus is an optional (and, based on the audio quality, suggested!)
dependency available from slackbuilds.org

You need a "svxlink" user and group:

 # groupadd -g 286 svxlink
 # useradd -u 286 -g svxlink \
     -d /var/spool/svxlink -s /bin/false svxlink

The recommended uid/gid is 286, you may want to check
http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt for other recommendations.

To run svxlink server you will need the svxlink-sounds package.

You may want to check the rc.svxlink scripts for startup options.
