libvorbisidec (Ogg Vorbis 'Tremor' integer playback codec)

The Tremor Vorbis I stream and file decoder provides an embeddable,
integer-only library [libvorbisidec] intended for decoding all current
and future Vorbis I compliant streams. The Tremor libvorbisidec library
exposes an API intended to be as similar as possible to the familiar
'vorbisfile' library included with the open source Vorbis reference
libraries distributed for free by Xiph.org.

Tremor can be used along with any ANSI compliant stdio implementation
for file/stream access, or use custom stream i/o routines provided
by an embedded environment. Both uses are described in detail in
documentation.
