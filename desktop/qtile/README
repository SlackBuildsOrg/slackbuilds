Qtile is a full-featured, hackable tiling window manager (X11 or
Wayland) written and configured in Python. Qtile is simple, small, and
extensible - it is easy to write your own layouts, widgets and built-in
commands.

You will need to build python3-cairocffi with its optional
python3-xcffib dependency.

python3-dbus-next is an optional dependency for qtile.
It sends notifications through dbus - please additionally install a
notification daemon such as dunst for displaying notifications on qtile.

This SlackBuild does not provide Wayland support. Slackware 15.0 is only
able to build wlroots 0.15. qtile >= 0.26.0 requires wlroots 0.17 (which
cannot be built with Slackware 15).
