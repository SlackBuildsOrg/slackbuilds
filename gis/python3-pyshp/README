The Python Shapefile Library (PyShp) provides read and write support for
the Esri Shapefile format. The Shapefile format is a popular Geographic
Information System vector data format created by Esri. For more
information about this format please read the well-written "ESRI
Shapefile Technical Description - July 1998" located at
http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/p dfs/shapefile.pdf . The Esri
document describes the shp and shx file formats. However a third file
format called dbf is also required. This format is documented on the web
as the "XBase File Format Description" and is a simple file-based
database format created in the 1960's.

Both the Esri and XBase file-formats are very simple in design and
memory efficient which is part of the reason the shapefile format
remains popular despite the numerous ways to store and exchange GIS data
available today.

Pyshp is compatible with Python 2.7-3.x, however this script only build
the python3 version.
