The NVIDIA Container Toolkit allows user to build and run GPU accelerated
containers. The toolkit includes a container runtime library and utilities
to automatically configure containers to leverage NVIDIA GPUs.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
