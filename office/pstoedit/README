pstoedit converts PostScript and PDF files to various vector graphic
formats. The resulting files can be edited or imported into various
drawing packages. Output formats include: AI, ASY, CGM, DXF, EMF, FIG,
GMFA, GMFI, GSCHEM, HPGL, IDRAW, KIL, LATEX2E, LWO, MIF, MNA, MPOST,
NOIXML, PCB, PCL, RIB, RPL, RTF, SK, SVG, SVM, SWF, TGIF, XAML, WMF
and variants of these. Output is also possible to text in different
formats and Java or TK code.

This version has some incompatibilities with ghostscript versions
earlier than 9.50 (eg 9.26 as in Slackware 14.4). If you get errors try 
using the option "-rdb". 

libEMF, plotutils, and ming are optional dependencies.
