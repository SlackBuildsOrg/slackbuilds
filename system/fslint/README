FSlint is a utility to find and clean various forms of lint on a
filesystem. I.E. unwanted or problematic cruft in your files or file
names. For example, one form of lint it finds is duplicate files.
It has both GUI and command line modes.

To access the command line tools one can cd to, or add to $PATH the
/usr/share/fslint/fslint directory on a standard install.
