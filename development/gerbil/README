Gerbil is an opinionated, some might even say tendentious, dialect of
Scheme designed for systems programming. It provides a state of the
art macro and module system on top of the Gambit runtime and compiler
and an extensive standard library. One way to think of Gerbil is as
the C++ to Marc Feeley's C.

The macro system is based on quote-syntax, and provides the full
meta-syntactic tower with a native implementation of syntax-case. It
also provides a full-blown module system, similar to PLT Scheme's
(sorry, Racket's) modules. The main difference from Racket is that
Gerbil modules are single instantiation, supporting high performance
ahead of time compilation and compiled macros.
