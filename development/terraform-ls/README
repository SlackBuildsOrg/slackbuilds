Terraform Language Server

The official Terraform language server (terraform-ls) maintained by
HashiCorp provides IDE features to any LSP-compatible editor.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
