libiptcdata is a library, written in C, for manipulating the
International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) metadata
stored within multimedia files such as images. This metadata can
include captions and keywords, often used by popular photo management
applications. The library provides routines for parsing, viewing,
modifying, and saving this metadata. The library is licensed under the
GNU Library General Public License (GNU LGPL).

The libiptcdata package also includes a command-line utility, iptc, for
editing IPTC data in JPEG files.

Python bindings are included by default but can be turned off by
invoking script with PY_BINDINGS=no
