Libqrencode is a fast and compact library for encoding data in a QR 
Code, a 2D symbology that can be scanned by handy terminals such as
a smartphone. The capacity of QR Code is up to 7000 digits or 4000
characters and has high robustness.

Libqrencode accepts a string or a list of data chunks then encodes
in a QR Code symbol as a bitmap array. While other QR Code
applications generate an image file, using libqrencode allows
applications to render QR Code symbols from raw bitmap data
directly. This library also contains a command-line utility outputs
QR Code images in various formats.

Libqrencode supports QR Code model 2, described in JIS (Japanese
Industrial Standards) X0510:2004 or ISO/IEC 18004. Most of the
features in the specification are implemented, such as:
 * Numeric, alphabet, Japanese kanji (Shift-JIS) or any 8-bit
   code can be embedded
 * Optimized encoding of a string
 * Structured-append of symbols
 * Micro QR Code (experimental)

Currently, the following features are not supported:
 * ECI and FNC1 mode
 * QR Code model 1 (deprecated)
