schemesh

Fusion between a Unix shell and a Lisp REPL

Schemesh is an interactive shell scriptable in Lisp.

It is primarily intended as a user-friendly Unix login shell,
replacing bash, zsh, pdksh etc.

As such, it supports interactive line editing, autocompletion, history
and the familiar Unix shell syntax: it can start commands, including
redirections, pipelines, job concatenation with ; && ||, groups
surrounded by { }, subshells surrounded by [ ], and manage
foreground/background jobs.

For more complex tasks, it seamlessly integrates a full Lisp REPL
backed by Chez Scheme.

Schemesh can be used as:

a replacement for traditional interactive Unix shell, as for example
bash/zsh/pdksh etc.

a Unix shell scriptable in Chez Scheme.

a Scheme REPL with additional syntax and functions to start, redirect
and manage Unix processes.

a Scheme library for starting, redirecting and managing Unix
processes.

For scripting and serious programming, schemesh completely replaces
the slow, clumsy and error-prone scripting language of a traditional
shell (yes, the author has opinions) with a full-featured Lisp REPL,
backed by the fast and open-source Chez Scheme compiler that generates
highly optimized native code.
