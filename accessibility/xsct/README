xsct (X11 set color temperature)

xsct is a UNIX tool which allows you to set the color temperature of
your screen. It is simpler than Redshift and f.lux. Based on code 
published by Ted Unangst in the public domain.

Minor modifications were made in order to get sct to:
* iterate over all screens of the default display and change the color
  temperature
* free the Display structure
* fix memleaks
* clean up code
* return EXIT_SUCCESS
