Siege is an http regression testing and benchmarking utility.  It was
designed to let web developers measure the performance of their code
under duress, to see how it will stand up to load on the internet.
Siege supports basic authentication, cookies, HTTP and HTTPS
protocols. It allows the user to hit a web server with a configurable
number of concurrent simulated users. Those users place the webserver
"under siege."
