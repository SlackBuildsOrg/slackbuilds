This provides the PPD (Postscript Printer Description) driver for
Brother DCP-L8410CDW printer and is needed by CUPS to support it.
This is merely a repackaging of the official "deb" package.

You can check if the PPD is installed correctly by:
$ lpinfo -m | grep 8410
  Brother/brother_dcpl8410cdw_printer_en.ppd Brother DCP-L8410CDW CUPS

To add the printer to CUPS, first its URI must be retrieved:
$ lpinfo -v
  ...
  network lpd://BRWD0123456789A/BINARY_P1

And eventually, the printer can be added to CUPS by:
# lpadmin                              \
    -p mybrother                       \   # name
    -L "Valhalla"                      \   # location
    -D "The Almighty Printer"          \   # description
    -E                                 \   # enable
    -v lpd://BRWD0123456789A/BINARY_P1 \   # device URI
    -P /usr/share/cups/model/brother_dcpl8410cdw_printer_en.ppd

Later, it may be removed with:
# lpadmin -x mybrother
