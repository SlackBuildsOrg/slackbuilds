This is VHBA (Virtual SCSI Host Bus adapter), a Linux kernel module
which acts as a low-level SCSI driver and which provides the SCSI
layer with a virtual SCSI adapter which can have multiple virtual
devices. It is part of the userspace-cdemu suite, a free GPL
CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for linux.

NOTE:
The resulting package will be specific for the kernel it was built on.

It is possible to build package for a different kernel version by
setting the KERNEL variable as in:
    KERNEL=5.15.161 ./vhba-module.SlackBuild
