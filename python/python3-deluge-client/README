python3-deluge-client (Very lightweight pure-python Deluge RPC Client)

A lightweight pure-python rpc client for deluge. Note, does not
support events and any additional replies from deluge will mess up
the datastream.

NOTE: This is a required dependency for another program, but it is not
required to be functional. Rather than adding all the dependencies of
deluge itself, deluge will not be added to REQUIRES line. If you need
deluge support with this module, you will need to install deluge itself.
