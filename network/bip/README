Bip is an irc proxy with SSL support, which means it keeps connected
to your preferred IRC servers, can store the logs for you, and even
send them back to your IRC client(s) upon connection.  You may want
to use bip to keep your logfiles (in a unique format and on a unique
computer) whatever your client is, when you connect from multiple
workstations, or when you simply want to have a playback of what was
said when you were away.
