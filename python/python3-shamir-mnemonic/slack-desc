# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-shamir-mnemonic:
python3-shamir-mnemonic: This SLIP describes a standard and interoperable implementation of
python3-shamir-mnemonic: Shamir's secret sharing (SSS). SSS splits a secret into unique parts
python3-shamir-mnemonic: which can be distributed among participants, and requires a specified
python3-shamir-mnemonic: minimum number of parts to be supplied in order to reconstruct the
python3-shamir-mnemonic: original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of parts
python3-shamir-mnemonic: does not leak information about the secret.
