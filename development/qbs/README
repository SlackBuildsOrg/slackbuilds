Qbs is a tool that helps simplify the build process for developing
projects across multiple platforms. Qbs can be used for any software
project, regardless of programming language, toolkit, or libraries
used.

NOTES:

1. Remove any previous Qbs installations before building this package.

2. Sometimes the old Qbs profiles do not work with updated version of
   Qbs. These files are located in ~/.config/QtProject/qbs directory.
   Deleting this directory and recreating the profiles is a possible
   workaround.
