redsea is a lightweight command-line FM-RDS decoder for Linux/macOS.
It supports a large subset of RDS features.

Decoded RDS groups are printed to the terminal as line-delimited JSON
objects or, optionally, undecoded hex blocks (-x). Please refer to the
wiki for input data formats.

Catch2 is an optional dependency for the unit tests.
