tangogps is an easy to use, fast, and lightweight mapping application
for use with or without GPS.  By default, tangoGPS uses map data
from the Openstreetmap project.  Additionally, a variety of other
repositories can be easily added.  The maps are downloaded and cached
for offline use while you drag or zoom the map.  Furthermore, you can
conveniently pre-cache areas with tangoGPS.

If connected to a GPS, your current position and track are shown
on the map, and you can log positional data for further processing,
e.g. for geocoding photos or uploading streets to Openstreetmap.
