Cinny Desktop - yet another Matrix client.

Cinny is a matrix client focusing primarily on simple, elegant and
secure interface. The desktop app is made with Tauri.

This SlackBuild is a re-packaged official deb archive.

Cinny is also able to be used directly from the web with your
electron supporting browser of choice.

There is no 32bit application available.

There is also no official arm64 package. The self-hosted
file here has been built from the official Tauri-based source
repository on a slackwareaarch64-current system to create the
(un)official deb package.
