Hy is a Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python.

Hy (or "Hylang" for long) is a multi-paradigm general-purpose
programming language in the Lisp family. It's implemented as a kind of
alternative syntax for Python. Compared to Python, Hy offers a variety
of extra features, generalizations, and syntactic simplifications, as
would be expected of a Lisp. Compared to other Lisps, Hy provides direct
access to Python's built-ins and third-party Python libraries, while
allowing you to freely mix imperative, functional, and object-oriented
styles of programming.
