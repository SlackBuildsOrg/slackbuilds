Unipro UGENE is a multiplatform open-source software with the main
goal of assisting molecular biologists without much expertise in
bioinformatics to manage, analyze and visualize their data.

UGENE integrates widely used bioinformatics tools within a common user
interface. The toolkit supports multiple biological data formats and
allows the retrieval of data from remote data sources. It provides
visualization modules for biological objects such as:

- annotated genome sequences
- Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assembly data
- multiple sequence alignments
- phylogenetic trees
- 3D structures

Most of the integrated algorithms are tuned for maximum performance by
the usage of multithreading and special processor instructions. UGENE
includes a visual environment for creating reusable workflows that can
be launched on local resources or in a High Performance Computing
(HPC) environment. UGENE is written in C++ using the Qt framework. The
built-in plugin system and structured UGENE API make it possible to
extend the toolkit with new functionality.

EXTERNAL TOOLS
UGENE can use and drive a number of external tools, providing a nice

recommended for the complete (and extended) functionality of the
program. All of them are available at SlackBuilds.org:
