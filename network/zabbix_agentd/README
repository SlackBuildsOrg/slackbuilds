zabbix_agentd is the Linux agent daemon used to monitor Linux boxes
and send the data to the zabbix server.

Zabbix offers advanced monitoring, alerting and visualization
features, including distributed monitoring, auto-discovery,
notifications, etcetera.

zabbix_agentd needs to run under its own user/group. This has been
assigned to the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change
it on your system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbixagent       UID: 266        GID: 266
  group:  zabbixagent                       GID: 266

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXAGENTUSER and ZABBIXAGENTGROUP variables when running the build
script.

zabbix_agentd uses group zabbix to write log file 
  (if you also have zabbix_server installed, it uses the same directory
  for log file)
  group:  zabbix                            GID: 228
