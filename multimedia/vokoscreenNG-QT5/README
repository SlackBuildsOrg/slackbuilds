vokoscreenNG for Windows and Linux is a powerful screencast creator
available in multiple languages. It allows you to record the screen,
a selected area, or a window (window recording is only available on
Linux). Supports audio recording from various sources. With integrated
camera support, you can make your videos more personal.

Includes tools such as systray, magnifier, countdown, timer,
Showclick, and support for Halo.

This is the version for Qt5.
