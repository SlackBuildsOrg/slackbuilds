QLog - Ham Radio Logbook

QLog is an Amateur Radio logging application for Linux, Windows and Mac
OS. It is based on the Qt framework and uses SQLite as database
back-end.

QLog aims to be as simple as possible, but to provide everything the 
operator expects from the log. This log is not currently focused on 
contests.
