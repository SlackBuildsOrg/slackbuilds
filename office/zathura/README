zathura (a PDF viewer focusing on keyboard interaction)

zathura is a highly customizable and functional PDF viewer based on
the poppler rendering library and the gtk+ toolkit. The idea behind
zathura is an application that provides a minimalistic and space
saving interface as well as an easy usage that mainly focuses on
keyboard interaction.

This build includes the zathura core and the zathura-pdf-poppler
plugin, by default. If you don't want zathura-pdf-poppler, you can
run the script with POPPLER=no set in the environment. In this case,
zathura will be useless until you install at least one of the plugins
listed below.

Other plugins exist to support other file types:

zathura-pdf-mupdf - Alternate PDF renderer (faster, maybe more accurate)
zathura-ps - PostScript
zathura-cb - Comic book archives (cbz/cbr/cb7/cbt)
zathura-djvu - DjVu

When upgrading zathura, you must rebuild all its plugins
against the new version of zathura, even if the version numbers
are the same.

Documentation on zathura's synctex support is poor; for some hints on 
using synctex with zathura, see:

Note: This is not the latest version of zathura; it is the latest
version that will build on Slackware 15.0. Don't expect this to be
upgraded until after the next Slackware release.
