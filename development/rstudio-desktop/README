RStudio IDE: the most popular coding environment for R

the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) is a set of tools
built to help you be more productive with R and Python. It includes a
console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution.
It also features tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and
managing your workspace.

RStudio is available in desktop and server versions. This is the DESKTOP
version, featuring:

* Syntax highlighting, code completion, and smart indentation
* Execute R code directly from the source editor
* Quickly jump to function definitions
* View content changes in real-time with the Visual Markdown Editor
* Easily manage multiple working directories
* Integrated R help and documentation
* Interactive debugger
* Extensive package development tools

At the moment, the script just repackages the Fedora/Redhat binaries,
provided by upstream.

NOTE 1:
RStudio currently only supports 64-bit systems. The last 32-bit version
is 1.1.463, provided by "rstudio-desktop-legacy", available at SBo.

NOTE 2:
RStudio 2024.12.1+563 is the last available version for Slackware 15.0.
