# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

c-blosc: c-blosc (a high performance compressor optimized for binary data)
c-blosc:
c-blosc: It has been designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster
c-blosc: than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach
c-blosc: via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc is the first compressor that is meant
c-blosc: not only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory,
c-blosc: but also to accelerate memory-bound computations.
c-blosc: It uses the blocking technique so as to reduce activity in the
c-blosc: memory bus as much as possible. In short, this technique works by
c-blosc: dividing datasets in blocks that are small enough to fit in caches.
