Cdk stands for 'Curses Development Kit' and it currently contains 21
ready to use widgets which facilitate the speedy development of full
screen curses programs.

This is a modified/enhanced version of Cdk. The intent of the
modifications is to preserve nominal compatibility with the original
Cdk, while fixing bugs and design limitations. Some macros such as
ObjOf() have been introduced to move details out of individual widgets
into common functionality (see the cdk_objs.h header). In addition,
fixed array limits have been removed, using new functions in some
instances which do not have the fixed limits.
