keyd is a low-level keyboard remapping daemon for Linux.

It operates at the evdev layer, before X11 or the Linux console
process input events, allowing per-device key remapping.

This makes keyd suitable for external keyboards, macro pads, or
special-purpose devices where tools like xmodmap or sxhkd are
insufficient.

Configuration files are read from:

  /etc/keyd/*.conf

keyd must be run as root to access input devices. No systemd
components are required.

See the keyd manual page for usage details.

The package does not include a startup script. To start keyd on
boot, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add a section like this:

if [ -x /usr/bin/keyd ]; then
  /usr/bin/keyd >/dev/null 2>&1 &
fi
