A suite of tools for manipulating the metadata of the dm-thin, dm-era
and dm-cache device-mapper targets.

Required by LVM2 to start and manage LVM volumes with above features.

The package also contains a patch for Slackware's mkinitrd.
It's required if you want to boot from a cached root partition.
To apply the patch run:

  cd /sbin
  patch -p0 < /usr/doc/thin-provisioning-tools-*/mkinitrd-1.4.X.patch

where X is the version of the currently installed mkinitrd.
