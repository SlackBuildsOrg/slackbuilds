The pytest testing tool makes it easy to write small tests, yet
scales to support complex functional testing.

This is installed with python3.

IMPORTANT: The scripts py.test and pytest are renamed to py.test3
and pytest3 respectively to avoid conflicts with the pytest installed
with python.

NOTE: py and iniconfig have automatic python3 support.

On Slackware 15.0, newer versions of python3-pytest (>= 7.2.0) require
a newer python-setuptools_scm for building new dependencies.
Therefore, this SlackBuild has kept python3-pytest at 7.1.3.
