RustDesk is a remote access and remote control software, that enables
remote maintenance of computers and other devices.

RustDesk is an open-source alternative to remote desktop software such
as TeamViewer. It can function without relying on additional tools
such as VPNs or port forwarding, even behind firewalls or NATs.

Important: This Slackbuild is particular as it downloads files from the
internet in addition to the three files referenced on SBo, requiring an
active internet connection to function properly.

This script installs RustDesk into /opt.
