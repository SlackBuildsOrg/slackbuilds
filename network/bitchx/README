bitchx (IRC client)

BitchX is a free software text-based IRC (Internet Relay Chat)
client for UNIX-like systems, originally based on ircII and heavily
influenced by EPIC.

The original BitchX hasn't been updated since 2014. This build is for
a fork by TheApacheCats that has many bugfixes and enhancements, and
was last updated in 2019.

The executable and man page are called BitchX (not bitchx).

Optional: BitchX makes use of MS-DOS-style (codepage 437) graphics for
its title screen. You can install misc/cp437 and run "cp347 BitchX"
to see the title screen as it was intended.
