OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD
version.

Added symbolic link to install a generic blas library that can be used
by Octave and R.

OpenBLAS has cpu specific targetted assembly code for speed
optimisation.

If running in a vm with QEMU cpu you need to specify a variable
TARGET=cpuname to the script where cpuname is one from the list in the
sourcecode file TargetList.txt

examples are TARGET=NEHALEM for an Intel i7 or TARGET=ATHLON for AMD
Athlon
