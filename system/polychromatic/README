Polychromatic is a vendor agnostic front-end for managing lighting,
RGB effects and some special functionality for keyboards, mice,
keypads and just about any other gaming peripheral on your GNU/Linux
system. The software aims to make it easy to create and co-ordinate
lighting effects that work across all compatible hardware, even if
you switch to another brand also supported by Polychromatic.

Currently the only supported backend for polychromatic is openrazer.
