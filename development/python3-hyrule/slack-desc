# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-hyrule: python3-hyrule (A utility library for the Hy programming language)
python3-hyrule:
python3-hyrule: Hyrule is a utility library for the Hy programming language. It can
python3-hyrule: be thought of as the Hy equivalent, or addition, to Python's standard
python3-hyrule: library. While intended primarily for Hy programs, its functions and
python3-hyrule: classes can be used in Python as with any other Python library; just
python3-hyrule: import hyrule. Hyrule's macros, on the other hand, are only really
python3-hyrule: usable in Hy.
