nwg-readme-browser (WebKitGTK-based README file browser)

Nwg-readme-browser was conceived as rtfm with a graphical user
interface. It searches the /usr/share/doc path for README.* files,
and displays them in WebKit2.WebView. It supports .md, .rst, .html
and plain text. It does not support .pdf format. Although the
program was written with nwg-shell for sway and Hyprland in mind,
it may also be used standalone.
