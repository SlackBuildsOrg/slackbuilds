python3-dogpile.cache (Caching interface to backends of any variety)

dogpile.cache is a caching API which provides a generic interface
to caching backends of any variety, and additionally provides API
hooks which integrate these cache backends with the locking mechanism
of dogpile.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions due to requiring newer version
of python than is available in Slackware 15.0 (python 3.10).
