RStudio is a cross-platform IDE for the R statistical computing
environment. It is available in desktop and server versions.
This builds the Linux desktop version.

RStudio currently only supports 64-bit systems. 

The last supported version of RStudio for 32-bit systems is 1.1.463.
A rstudio-desktop-legacy SlackBuild for 32-bit systems is available.

Troubleshooting tip: 
If you experience a linker error involving
/usr/lib/libQt5WebEngine.so.5.15.3, you may be using a multilib system.
In that case, I would suggest uninstalling qt5-compat32 before building
RStudio, then reinstalling qt5-compat32 after installing RStudio.
