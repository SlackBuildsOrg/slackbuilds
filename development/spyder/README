Spyder (previously known as Pydee) is a powerful interactive
development environment for the Python language with advanced editing,
interactive testing, debugging and introspection features.

spyder 5.4.0 is the last available version in Slackware 15.0. Newer
versions require a newer python3-lsp-server.
