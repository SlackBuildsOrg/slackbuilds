Snort is an open source network intrusion detection and prevention
system. It is capable of performing real-time traffic analysis,
alerting, blocking and packet logging on IP networks. It utilizes
a combination of protocol analysis and pattern matching in order to
detect a anomalies, misuse and attacks.

Snort uses a flexible rules language to describe activity that can
be considered malicious or anomalous as well as an analysis engine
that incorporates a modular plugin architecture. Snort is capable
of detecting and responding in real-time, sending alerts, performing
session sniping, logging packets, or dropping sessions/packets when
deployed in-line.

Snort has three primary functional modes.  It can be used as a packet
sniffer like tcpdump(1), a packet logger (useful for network traffic
debugging, etc), or as a full blown network intrusion detection and
prevention system.

You need to create a new UID/GID before building snort
groupadd -g 395 snort
useradd -u 395 -g 395 -d /var/log/snort snort

If you need to port the old snort configuration files to new lua format,
you can use snort2lua with -c parameter:
    snort2lua -c snort.conf
    or
    snort2lua --conf-file snort.conf
if you want to convert Snort 2 rules into Snort 3 rules, use:
    Snort2lua -c snort2.rules -r snort3.rules

For more information about running Snort on Slackware, please see
