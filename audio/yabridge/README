Yet Another way to use Windows VST plugins on Linux. Yabridge seamlessly
supports using both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows VST2 and VST3 plugins in a
64-bit Linux VST host as if they were native VST2 and VST3 plugins, with
optional support for plugin groups to enable inter-plugin communication
for VST2 plugins and quick startup times. Its modern concurrent
architecture and focus on transparency allows yabridge to be both fast
and highly compatible, while also staying easy to debug and maintain.

This script will build yabridge bitbridge both 64bit and 32bit
on Slackware64 and only 32bit plugin host on Slackware32 with
yabridgectl helper tool for all versions of Slackware.
This program depends on any 64+32 (Slackware64 multilib) or
a 32 (Slackware32) version of wine with esync and/or fsync.
No ARM support yet.

Make sure you have configured you're system with real-time priority.

Don't forget WINEESYNC=1 or WINEFSYNC=1 environment variables or
you will have problems with performance and xruns.
You can set them in /etc/profile like this:
export WINEFSYNC=1
export WINEESYNC=1

build options
ARG_CLAP="false"
ARG_VST3="true"
ARG_WINEDBG="false"
