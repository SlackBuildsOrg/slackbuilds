JS8Call is software using the JS8 Digital Mode providing weak
signal keyboard to keyboard messaging to Amateur Radio Operators.

JS8Call is an experiment to test the feasibility of a digital
mode with the robustness of FT8, combined with a messaging and
network protocol layer for weak signal communication on HF, using
a keyboard messaging style interface. It is not designed for any
specific purpose other than connecting amateur radio operators who
are operating under weak signal conditions. JS8Call is heavily
inspired by WSJT-X, Fldigi, and FSQCall and would not exist
without the hard work and dedication of the many developers in the
amateur radio community.
