Bazel is an open-source build and test tool that scalably supports
multi-language and multi-platform projects.

Only 1 version of OpenJDK may be installed at a time while building
Bazel. For example, if both zulu-openjdk8 and zulu-openjdk21 are
installed, please uninstall zulu-openjdk8 before building Bazel.
