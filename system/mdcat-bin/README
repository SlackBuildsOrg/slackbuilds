mdcat-bin (cat and less for markdown)

mdcat is a fancy "cat" (or "less") for Markdown (aka CommonMark).
mdcat renders Markdown in a terminal, using escape codes for
highlighting and formatting. It works in any terminal, including the
Linux console, but some features (e.g. italics, strikethrough, images)
are only supported on certain terminals (such as kitty, for images).

For convenience, mdcat is also installed as mdless (which behaves the
same as "mdcat -p").

The package installs completion support for bash (requires
bash-completion from Slackware /extra), zsh, and fish, and
tab-completion should "just work" after the package is installed.

PowerShell completion is also included, but has to be manually
set up. To do this, edit your PowerShell profile (usually
~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1) and add the following lines:

/usr/share/mdcat-bin/powershell-completions/_mdcat.ps1
/usr/share/mdcat-bin/powershell-completions/_mdless.ps1

This is a repack of the official binary, which only exists for
x86_64. There are no 32-bit or aarch64 binaries, sorry.
