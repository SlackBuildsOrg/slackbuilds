What is Libwhisker:
Libwhisker is a Perl module geared specificly for HTTP testing.
Libwhisker has a few design principles:
- Portable: runs with 0 changes on Unix, Windows, etc (100% Perl)
- Flexible: designed with a 'no rules' approach
- Contained: designed to not require external modules when possible
- Localized: does not require installation to use (except for this
  SlackBuild ;-) )
