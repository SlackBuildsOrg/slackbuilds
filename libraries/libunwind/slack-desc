# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libunwind:
libunwind: A portable and efficient C programming interface to determine the
libunwind: call-chain of a program. The API additionally provides a means to
libunwind: manipulate the preserved state of each call-frame and to resume
