suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
sparse matrices. The package includes the following libraries:

AMD: approximate minimum degree ordering.
CAMD: constrained approximate minimum degree ordering.
COLAMD: column approximate minimum degree ordering.
CCOLAMD: constrained column approximate minimum degree ordering.
CHOLMOD: sparse Cholesky factorization.
CXSparse: CSparse extended: complex matrix, int and long int support.
KLU & BTF: sparse LU factorization, primarily for circuit simulation.
LDL: a simple LDL^t factorization.
SQPR: a multithread, multifrontal, rank-revealing sparse QR
      factorization method.
UMFPACK: sparse LU factorization.
RBio: read/write files in Rutherford/Boeing format.
GraphBLAS: graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra
Mongoose: graph partitioning
ssget: MATLAB and Java interface to the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection

Suitesparse is an optional dependency for the octave package.

CXSparse is a superset of CSparse, and the two share common header
names, so it does not make sense to build both. CXSparse is built
by default.

SlackBuilds.org also has all the parts of this suite as individual
builds - DO NOT try and install the individual parts and the suite;
pick one or the other.

For Slackware 14.2, suitesparse's version is being held at 5.7.2.
Later versions (5.8.n) are not compatible with 14.2 supplied version
of mpfr (3.1.4).
