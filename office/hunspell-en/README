In this package are five dictionaries of English usage - Australian,
Canadian, United States, and two forms of British English.

The reason the previous maintainer, Donald Cooley <chytraeu@sdf.org>,
included two forms of British English dictionaries are:
1. The -ise suffix is more commonly used by British speakers and all
other forms such as en_DK, en_IE, en_IN, etc are symbolic links to
en_GB-ise.
2. the en_GB-ize/en_GB-oxendict which uses the -ize suffix is known
as Oxford English Dictionary Spelling and is generally favored for
academic, formal, and technical writing.
