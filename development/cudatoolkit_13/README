CUDA Toolkit CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture. It
enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the
power of the GPU.

NOTE:
- the binary file to download is 5.5 GB
- the temporary package file will need 7 GB
- the final package will be over 4 GB (7 GB when installed).
Be sure to have enough free space before building this.

By default, the available nsight components are not included in
the final package. They may be enabled by setting the NSIGHT
environment variable to yes when building the package e.g.
    NSIGHT=yes bash cudatoolkit_13.SlackBuild

This is version 13, which should be installable together with
the default version 10.
You can activate it by sourcing /etc/profile.d/cuda-12.9.sh

NOTE:
This build is beta. CUDA is large and complicated,
suggestions welcome. If unsure, I suggest using the default
CUDA 10.
However, mpv and ffmpeg compile fine with this CUDA, and hardware
accelerated video decoding works.
