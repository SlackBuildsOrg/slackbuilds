kForth is an implementation of the Forth programming language
and environment. The user may write Forth programs with an editor,
load these program files from kForth, and run them.

kForth-32, version 2.x provides a large subset of, and conforms
primarily to the Forth-94 standard (ANS Forth) for the Forth
language.
However, it also includes new concepts and words from the
Forth-2012 specification. kForth-32 v 2.x is intended to bridge
the gap from the older kForth-32 1.x branch to a future kForth-32
3.x series, the 32-bit counterpart of kForth-64, which is more
closely in conformance with Forth-2012.

kForth-32 is designed to be installed on a 32-bit linux operating
system.
It will not install on 64-bit Slackware unless multilib support is
installed.
