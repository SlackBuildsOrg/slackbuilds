SpliX is a set of CUPS printer drivers for SPL (Samsung Printer
Language) printers. It covers several Samsung and Xerox printers. See
ppd/*.ppd in the tarball for supported models. Only SPL2 and SPLc
printers are supported.

JBIG-KIT is an optional dependency. To build SpliX with support for
JBIG printers:

  JBIG=yes ./splix.SlackBuild

IMPORTANT:
If you are upgrading your current version, you MUST delete your
printer in the CUPS interface and install it again. This operation
MUST be done since CUPS caches a copy of the PPD file, so if the PPD
changes from one version of splix to the next, CUPS will still have
the cached copy.
