Radeon Open Compute platforM (ROCm) is a software stack, composed
primarily of open-source software, that provides the tools for
programming AMD Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), from low-level
kernels to high-level end-user applications.

Specifically, ROCm provides the tools for HIP (Heterogeneous-computing
Interface for Portability), OpenCL and OpenMP. These include compilers,
libraries for high-level functions, debuggers, profilers and runtimes.

It is aimed for this to become a general toolkit for AMD GPU
programming by using a subset of the latest of the 7.x.x series of ROCm
components. Suggestions are therefore welcome regarding additional ROCm
components to include in the SlackBuild (please email the maintainer).

This SlackBuild uses precompiled blobs downloaded from the repo at
radeon.com (much like the cudatoolkit* SlackBuilds which download and
rearrange a precompiled blob from nvidia.com). Building these
precompiled blobs from their source codes remains an exercise for the
future.

Building this SlackBuild will download over 6G of required files,
which will be repackaged to create the final Slackware package, which
will itself be nearly 5G (expanding to well over 20G when installed).

This SlackBuild should not be installed at the same time as opencl-amd
(from the libraries category) with which it is likely to conflict.
