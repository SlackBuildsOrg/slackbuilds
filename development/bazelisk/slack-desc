# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bazelisk: Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel written in Go. It automatically picks
bazelisk: a good version of Bazel given your current working directory,
bazelisk: downloads it from the official server (if required) and then
bazelisk: transparently passes through all command-line arguments to the real
bazelisk: Bazel binary.
