sane-airscan -- SANE backend for AirScan (eSCL) and WSD document
scanners.

Similar to how most modern network printers support "driverless"
printing,
using the universal vendor-neutral printing protocol, many modern
network scanners and MFPs support "driverless" scanning.

Driverless scanning comes in two flavors:

- Apple AirScan or AirPrint scanning (official protocol name is eSCL)
- Microsoft WSD, or WS-Scan (term WSD means "Web Services for Devices)

This backend implements both protocols, choosing automatically between
them.
It was successfully tested with many devices from Brother, Canon, Dell,
Kyocera, Lexmark, Epson, HP, OKI, Panasonic, Pantum, Ricoh, Samsung
and Xerox both in WSD and eSCL modes.

For eSCL devices, Apple maintains a comprehensive list of compatible
devices, but please note, this list contains not only scanners and MFP,
but pure printers as well.

This backend doesn't require to install and doesn't conflict with
vendor-provided proprietary software like ScanGear from Canon, HPLIP
from HP and so on.
