LuaRocks is a deployment and management system for Lua modules,
with automatic dependency checking, with access to remote
repositories and local rock source trees.

This build script by default builds for a "default Lua", which
will be 5.1 on "older" SBo tree, and 5.4 on "newer" SBo tree,
and on "-current" as of 2024-10-23.

It will pick up the compatibility interpreter "Lua 5.1", if
it is present.
