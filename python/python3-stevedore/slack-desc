# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-stevedore: python3-stevedore (Manage dynamic plugins for Python applications)
python3-stevedore:
python3-stevedore: Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure
python3-stevedore: and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions
python3-stevedore: ("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own
python3-stevedore: library for doing this, using __import__ or importlib. stevedore
python3-stevedore: avoids creating yet another extension mechanism by building on top
python3-stevedore: of setuptools entry points. The code for managing entry points tends
python3-stevedore: to be repetitive, though, so stevedore provides manager classes for
python3-stevedore: implementing common patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.
