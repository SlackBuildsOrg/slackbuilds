xmlrpc-c (modular implementation of XML-RPC for C and C++)

XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the
Internet.  It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends it
to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.

This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for C and
C++.

The library also provides a variation on XML-RPC that works better in
some cases (but is not standard): packet stream XML-RPC.  XML-RPC For
C and C++ is designed for Unix and is most tested on unix. As far as
we know, it works on any reasonably standard unix.
