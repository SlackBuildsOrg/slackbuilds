FocusWriter is a fullscreen, distraction-free word processor designed
to immerse you as much as possible in your work. 
The program autosaves your progress, and reloads the last files you
had open to make it easy to jump back in during your next writing
session, and has many other features that make it such that only one
thing matters: your writing.

This version of Focuswriter uses qt6, which is required for version
above 1.7.6. If you do not want qt6, use the focuswriter SlackBuild
which is stuck at 1.7.6.
Both packages are mutually exclusive.
