MegaTunix is the only native tuning software that supports the
majority of megasquirt firmwares. It has been redesigned in such a way
as to be extensible to support new firmware variants with little to no
new code needing to be written. The new design permits the gui tabs
that relate to MegaSquirt variables to be redesigned using the Glade
GUI designer for windows or Glade gui designer for Unix to change or
alter the gui look/feel to accomodate new controls on more advanced
firmwares.
