twind is a simple daemon serving static files over the gemini protocol.

It is intended to have as few knobs as possible and has no support for
a configuration file.

twind is named after the latin word for gemini - twins.

Features:
 * Serving static gemini files
 * Virtual hosts
 * MIME handling
 * IPv4 and IPv6 support

It doesn't support CGI handling and probably never will. There are more
advanced gemini servers out there if you look for fancy stuff.

twind needs a dedicated user called '_twind' and directory to run.
User will be created with SlackBuild script automatically: 'make user'

By default, the user ID for _twind when created is set to 4000. You can
change this if wish declaring variable 'TWIND_ID' for what you need:

 TWIND_ID=(UID) ./twind.SlackBuild

Or forget above and do this manually:

 # useradd -d /var/twind -s /sbin/nologin -u 4000 _twind

Nota bene: 'TWIND_ID' is useless if you created the user manually.

twind can create auto-signed TLS certificate if you wish, just declare
hostname on 'TWIND_HN' variable:

 TWIND_HN=(DOMAIN) ./twind.SlackBuild

Is possible the use of both in same time:

 TWIND_ID=1234 TWIND_HN=slackware.wine ./twind.SlackBuild

For undo the action of user creation (e.g. case you uninstalled twind):

 # userdel -r _twind

---

SECURITY CONCERN
 twind needs root permissions to start and will drop its privileges as
 soon as possible. It will also chroot to /var/twind

README.md on doc folder has all informations or look out on Github.

NOTE of maintainer: Makefile was adapted because the original is
"turbid"

All respect for the creator of twind, it is a good and simple Gemini
Server.

Enjoy ;-)
