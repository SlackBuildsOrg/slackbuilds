raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames
programming and it is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib
and by XNA framework.

Wayland support can be enabled with WAYLAND=ON when building the
package.

Set GLFW=ON to use a system-wide installation of GLFW instead
of raylib's bundled one.
