game-devices-udev (udev rules for game-devices)

This package contains udev rules to make supported gamepad and VR
controllers available with user-grade permissions. A full list of the
recognized brands and devices (with vendor and product IDs) are
available in the README.devices file.

All controller rules are installed by default. The following variables
can be passed with VARIABLE=NO to the SlackBuild script to not install
that rule.
