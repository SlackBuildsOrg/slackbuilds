# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-hylang: python3-hylang (Lisp dialect that's embedded in Python)
python3-hylang:
python3-hylang: Hy (or "Hylang" for long) is a multi-paradigm general-purpose
python3-hylang: programming language in the Lisp family. It's implemented as a kind
python3-hylang: of alternative syntax for Python. Compared to Python, Hy offers a
python3-hylang: variety of extra features, generalizations, and syntactic
python3-hylang: simplifications, as would be expected of a Lisp. Compared to other
python3-hylang: Lisps, Hy provides direct access to Python's built-ins and
python3-hylang: third-party Python libraries, while allowing you to freely mix
python3-hylang: imperative, functional, and object-oriented styles of programming.
