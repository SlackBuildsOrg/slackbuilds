kiwix-tools-bin (offline access for Wikipedia)

Kiwix enables you to have the whole Wikipedia at hand wherever you go!
On a boat, in the middle of nowhere or in Jail, Kiwix gives you access
to the whole human knowledge. You don't need Internet, everything is
stored on your computer, USB flash drive or DVD!

kiwix-tools-bin provides all the three binaries by default:
 kiwix-serve  - Kiwix HTTP Server
 kiwix-manage - Kiwix Library Manager
 kiwix-search - Find articles using a fulltext search pattern

All this above is used for manipulate ZIM files.

This is a repack of the official binaries; it does not compile from
source. Only 32-bit x86, 64-bit x86_64, and 64-bit aarch64 are
supported.

For aarch64, since there's currently no way to give the aarch64 download
URL in the .info file, you'll have to download it manually. The file is:

https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-tools/kiwix-tools_linux-aarch64-3.7.0.tar.gz

MD5 hash of that: 12ab8a0d67dee5f63c0a85d9d089b5f2

Note: currently there is no kiwix-tools build that compiles from source.
If someday someone submits one, be aware that it will likely conflict
with this build.
