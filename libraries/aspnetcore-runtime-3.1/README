.NET Core is an open-source, general-purpose development platform
maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub.
It's cross-platform (supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux)
and can be used to build device, cloud, and IoT applications.

This package contains everything you need to run a ASP.NET application.
It includes ASP.NET Core runtime and .NET Core runtime.
If you want to build apps, install .NET Core SDK (dotnet-sdk-3.1), which
contains these runtimes too.

NOTE: This release has reached end of life, meaning it is no longer
supported. It is recommended to move to a supported release, such as
.NET 6.0.
