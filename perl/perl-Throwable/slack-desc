# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Throwable: perl-Throwable (a role for classes that can be thrown)
perl-Throwable:
perl-Throwable: Throwable is a role for classes that are meant to be thrown as
perl-Throwable: exceptions to standard program flow. It is very simple and does only
perl-Throwable: two things: saves any previous value for $@ and calls die $self.
perl-Throwable:
perl-Throwable: Throwable is implemented with Moo, so you can stick to Moo or use
perl-Throwable: Moose, as you prefer.
