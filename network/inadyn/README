In-a-dyn is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client with HTTPS
support. It is commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions,
used in off-the-shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate the
task of keeping your DNS record up to date with any IP address changes
from your ISP. It can also be used in installations with redundant
(backup) connections to the Internet.
