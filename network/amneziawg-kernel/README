AmneziaWG is a contemporary version of the popular VPN protocol,
WireGuard. It's a fork of WireGuard and offers protection against
detection by Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems. At the same time, it
retains the simplified architecture and high performance of the
original.

The progenitor of AmneziaWG, WireGuard, is known for its efficiency, but
it does have issues with detection due to distinctive packet
signatures. AmneziaWG addresses this problem by employing advanced
obfuscation methods, allowing its traffic to blend seamlessly with
regular internet traffic. As a result, AmneziaWG maintains high
performance while adding an extra layer of stealth, making it a superb
choice for those seeking a fast and discreet VPN connection.

Features of AmneziaWG include:

- Availability with AmneziaVPN on all platforms.
- Low energy consumption.
- Minimal configuration needed.
- Undetectable by DPI analysis systems, resistant to blocking.
- Operates over the UDP network protocol.

This supplies the kernel module for AmneziaWG. You need to install
amneziawg-tools to configure your WireGuard tunnels.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
  KERNEL=5.15.187 ./amneziawg-kernel.SlackBuild
