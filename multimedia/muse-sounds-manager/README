Muse Sounds Manager (Linux Muse Hub) is a new label of optional
high quality playback instruments for MuseScore 4.
​
Painstakingly recorded and edited specifically for the custom and
revolutionary playback engine that powers these applications,
they are capable of rendering incredibly lifelike results which
breathe realism and emotion into your compositions.

The first releases from Muse Sounds cover the symphony orchestra
and choral voices. Incredibly, these beautifully crafted
instrument packs are available exclusively in Muse Hub
completely free.​

Notes:

a) This is still beta software but does what is says in the box.
   It runs only on x86_64 machines.

b) Playing the "short preview" clips crashes the program,
   solution is still under investigation.

c) downloaded samples are placed in $HOME/.muse-sounds-manager,
   additional data in $HOME/.local/share/MuseSampler,
   don't forget to clean-up these is you uninstall.

d) This software is not open source.
