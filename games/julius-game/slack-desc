# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

julius-game: julius-game (open source re-implementation of Caesar III)
julius-game:
julius-game: The aim of Julius is to re-create the exact same logic that the
julius-game: original Caesar 3 uses, with full savegame compatibility, but with
julius-game: some small user interface enhancements, like widescreen support. The
julius-game: same logic also means that any gameplay bugs present in Caesar 3 will
julius-game: also be present in Julius.
julius-game:
julius-game: It is meant as a drop-in replacement for Caesar 3, with the same look
julius-game: and feel, so there will be no major UI changes.
