ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports engines created
using SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in
various LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle,
and others. ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM
games - currently Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword I & II, and Simon
the Sorcerer 1 & 2.

ScummVM optionally uses libmpeg2.
