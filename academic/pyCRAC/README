The pyCRAC package is a collection of python scripts to analyse high
throughput data generated by RNA-sequencing, especially of molecules
crosslinked by UV to an immunoprecipitated protein of interest (i.e.
data generated by CLIP or CRAC protocols).
It can be used to remove duplicate reads,tackles directional libraries
and reports sense and anti-sense hits.

A pipeline that streamlines the analysis of a group of CRAC datasets 
is available at https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/sgrannem/crac_pipelines and
depends on the python package 'ruffus', also at slackbuilds.org.
