Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for
high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids.
It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations
of clusters.

The Ganglia web frontend files will be stored under
/var/www/htdocs/ganglia directory. You can set WWWPATH to the
desired place for your web server. Example:
  WWWPATH=/var/www/ganglia ./ganglia-web.SlackBuild
