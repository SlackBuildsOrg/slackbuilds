GDAL is a library for reading and writing raster geospatial data
formats, and is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by
the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a
single abstract data model to the calling application for all
supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful
command-line utilities for data translation and processing.

The related OGR library (which is part of the GDAL source tree)
provides a similar capability for simple features vector data.

The following optional requirements are detected automatically:

  freexl, hdf, hdf5, libkml, netcdf, postgresql, xerces-c,
  libspatialite, SFCGAL, libheif

To enable OpenCL GPU-accelerated performance, specify the option
OPENCL=yes (requires either nvidia-driver or amd-app-sdk with 
suitable GPU hardware to run).

To build JAVA bindings, specify JAVA=yes (it requires a java JDK and
ant).

By default, the script does not build nor run the tests. You can use the
option TESTBUILD=YES to build and run the tests before the make install
part.
