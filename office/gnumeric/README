The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the GNOME desktop environment: 
a project to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.
The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet, rather
than attempting to clone existing applications.  However, Gnumeric
can read files saved with other spreadsheets and offers a
customizable feel that attempts to minimize the costs of transition.
