rust-opt installs a limited set of Rust stable binaries to /opt/rust.
This is to allow Rust-based SlackBuilds to build more recent versions
than would be possible with system Rust.

To use the rust-opt binaries in a SlackBuild, make the following export
statements:

export PATH="/opt/rust/bin:$PATH"
if [ -z "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" ]; then
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/rust/lib$LIBDIRSUFFIX"
else
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/rust/lib$LIBDIRSUFFIX:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
fi

If your SlackBuild experiences build failures on 64-bit systems, please
ensure that the LIBDIRSUFFIX variable is set.

rust-opt is not intended as a substitute for rustup or for the Slackware
Rust package in terms of Rust development purposes.

Separate downloads are available for x86_64, i686 and ARM.
