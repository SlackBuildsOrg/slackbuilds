Colored, it's a simple Python library for color and formatting in
terminal. Collection of color codes and names for 256 color terminal
setups. Colored now supports RGB color mode. As "true color" graphic
cards with 16 to 24 bits of color became common, applications began
to support 24-bit colors. Terminal emulators supporting setting 24-bit
foreground and background colors with escape sequences include Xterm,
KDE's Konsole, and iTerm, as well as all libvte based terminals,
including GNOME Terminal.

The colors work with most terminals and terminals emulators.
ANSI/VT100 escape sequences can be used in every programming languages.
