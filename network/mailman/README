Mailman (the GNU Mailing List Manager)

Unlike other SlackBuilds which have a /usr installation prefix, this
script will install Mailman to /opt/mailman instatead. This is done
to simplify the build process since Mailman attemps to install itself
into many non-standard directories in the prefix directory. Therefore,
it is installed as a self-contained and easily-removable location
in /opt.

It may be that you wish to keep Mailman's lists database in /var/mailman
instead of /opt/mailman/var/mailman, in which case you should adjust the
VAR_PREFIX variable at runtime. For example:

  VAR_PREFIX="/var/mailman" ./mailman.SlackBuild

This SlackBuild assumes the webserver group name to be "apache", 
which should work just fine for you if you have the Slackware 
httpd package installed.

If you wish to use a diffent webserver then set the group name
accordingly by passing is to the script via the CGI_GID variable at
runtime. Eg:

  CGI_GID="lighttpd" ./mailman.SlackBuild

This script also expects there to be a user and group called "mailman", 
with uid and gid of 204 (see http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt):

  # groupadd -g 204 mailman
  # useradd -u 204 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -g mailman mailman

If you execute the script without creating this user and group, it won't
build the Mailman package.

NOTE:
You must run /opt/mailman/bin/check_perms -f (using root) after
installation/upgrade and before running mailman daemon to fix permission
needed by this package.
