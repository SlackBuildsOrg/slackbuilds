.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
tnfsd \fBdirectory\fP [\fB\-c\fP \fIusername\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
TNFS is a simplified Internet file transfer protocol, designed for
simplicity and ease of implementation on small systems, such as 8\-bit
computers. It\(aqs simpler than NFS, SMB, or FTP. It\(aqs similar to TFTP,
but has features TFTP lacks.
.sp
\fBtnfsd\fP is the server for the TNFS protocol. It listens for clients
on UDP and TCP port 16384. Most 8\-bit clients use UDP, and the Linux
client \fBtnfs\-fuse\fP uses TCP.
.sp
The mandatory \fBdirectory\fP option is the root of the TNFS filesystem
tree.
.sp
The \fB\-c\fP \fIusername\fP option requires \fBtnfsd\fP to be run as
\fIroot\fP\&. If given, \fBtnfsd\fP will \fBchroot\fP(2) to the \fIdirectory\fP,
then drop its root privileges and run as the \fIusername\fP user instead.
.sp
Even without \fBchroot\fP, \fBtnfsd\fP will not deliberately allow access
to files outside the \fIdirectory\fP\&. The \fB\-c\fP option is a safety net,
in case there\(aqs a bug in \fBtnfsd\fP that allows such access (currently,
no such bug is known of).
.sp
Note that \fBtnfsd\fP can be started by a normal user, since it uses an
unprivileged UDP port. The \fB\-c\fP option won\(aqt work in this case.
.sp
\fBtnfsd\fP logs various information to standard error. If compiled with
\fI\-DUSAGE_LOG\fP, the log includes all mount, umount, and file transfer
requests including the client IP addresses.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
\fBtnfsd\fP is designed to be simple, so the following list of
limitations should not be read as complaints or feature requests.
.sp
There is no way to run multiple \fBtnfsd\fP instances on the same
host, not even on a multi\-homed host. The default UDP port cannot
be changed; neither can the IP address used for binding (which is
\fI0.0.0.0\fP, aka \fIINADDR_ANY\fP). Also, there\(aqs no concept of virtual
hosts. If you \fIreally\fP want to run multiple instances, use containers
or virtual machines.
.sp
There\(aqs no way to limit which hosts may access \fBtnfsd\fP using any
mechanism such as \fBtcpd\fP(8). Firewall rules may be used instead,
e.g. \fBiptables\fP(8).
.sp
There isn\(aqt a way to share a directory read\-only with the current
\fBtnfsd\fP implementation. However, filesystem permissions can be used
to prevent the daemon from writing to the shared directory.
