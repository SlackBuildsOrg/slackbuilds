# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Sort-Versions: perl-Sort-Versions (sorting of revision-like numbers)
perl-Sort-Versions:
perl-Sort-Versions: Sort::Versions allows easy sorting of mixed non-numeric and numeric
perl-Sort-Versions: strings, like the 'version numbers' that many shared library systems
perl-Sort-Versions: and revision control packages use. This is quite useful if you are
perl-Sort-Versions: trying to deal with shared libraries. It can also be applied to
perl-Sort-Versions: applications that intersperse variable-width numeric fields within
perl-Sort-Versions: text. Other applications can undoubtedly be found.
