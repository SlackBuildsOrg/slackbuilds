googler is a power tool to Google (Web & News) and Google
Site Search from the command-line. It shows the title, URL
and abstract for each result, which can be directly opened in
a browser from the terminal. Results are fetched in pages (with
page navigation). Supports sequential searches in a single googler
instance.

googler was initially written to cater to headless servers without
X. You can integrate it with a text-based browser. However, it has
grown into a very handy and flexible utility that delivers much
more. For example, fetch any number of results or start anywhere,
limit search by any duration, define aliases to google search any
number of websites, switch domains easily... all of this in a very
clean interface without ads or stray URLs. The shell completion
scripts make sure you don't need to remember any options.

googler isn't affiliated to Google in any way.
