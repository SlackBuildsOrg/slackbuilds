Feather is a free, open-source Monero wallet for Linux, Tails, macOS
and Windows. It is written in C++ with the Qt framework.

Various features can be enabled/disabled by passing variables to the
script (VAR=yes/no ./feather.SlackBuild):
LOCALMONERO=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable LocalMonero feature)
XMRIG=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable XMRig feature)
DONATE_BEG=yes|no (default: yes)
    (disable the dreaded donate requests)
USE_DEVICE_TREZOR=yes|no (default:yes)
    (disable Trezor hardware wallet support)
WITH_SCANNER=yes|no (default:no)
    (enable the webcam QR code scanner)

As of version 2.5.2 of Feather, qt6 is now a mandatory dependency.

tor is another optional dependency; a Tor daemon is required to
connect to .onion nodes and the websocket server.

If the XMRig feature is enabled, you can point to a system-wide binary
for the miner executable (under the "Settings" tab in the "Miner" tab)
by installing the xmrig package from SlackBuilds.org. Said binary will
be located at "/usr/bin/xmrig".
