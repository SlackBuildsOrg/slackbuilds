tcc (Tiny C Compiler)

Tiny C Compiler is a very fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers,
it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external assembler
or linker because TCC does that for you.

TCC supports ANSI C and most of ISO C99 and many GNUC extensions,
including inline assembly. tcc was written by Fabrice Bellard and is
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Currently, tcc development happens in the github repo at
https://github.com/TinyCC/tinycc

By default, both native and cross compilers for various systems (Win32,
Win64, ARM, OSX, etc) are built. If you want to skip the cross
compilers, pass CROSS=no to the script.

If you want to run the tcc test suite, pass TEST=yes to the script. The
test results will be packaged as "/usr/doc/tcc-$VERSION/make_test.txt".

By default, tcc is compiled with gcc. You can set CC in the
environment to another compiler. If you already have tcc installed,
you can bootstrap it with CC=tcc, for instance.
