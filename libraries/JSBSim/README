JSBSim is a multi-platform, general purpose object-oriented Flight
Dynamics Model (FDM) written in C++. The FDM is essentially the
physics & math model that defines the movement of an aircraft, rocket,
etc., under the forces and moments applied to it using the various
control mechanisms and from the forces of nature. JSBSim can be run in
a standalone batch mode flight simulator (no graphical displays
a.k.a. console mode) for testing and study, or integrated with the
Unreal engine, FlightGear and many other simulation environments.
