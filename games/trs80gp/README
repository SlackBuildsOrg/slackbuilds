trs80gp (TRS-80 Model 1,2,3,4,12,16,6000,MC-10,DT-1,Videotex Emulator)

trs80gp primarily emulates the "gray" line of TRS-80 computers made by
Tandy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They are known as the Model
I, Model II, Model III, Model 4, Model 4P, Model 4D, Model 12, Model
16 and Model 6000. Also emulated are the TRS-80 Micro Color Computer
Model MC-10, the TRS-80 DT-1 Data Terminal, TRS-80 Videotex and the
Electric Crayon external colour display.

Unlike many emulators, trs80gp includes the ROMs and boot disk images
for the target systems, built right into the executable. There are
also some extra disk images (mostly of various DOSes) installed to
/usr/share/trs80gp/disks/. These should be usable with other emulators
such as sdltrs or xtrs.

trs80gp is closed-source binary-only software. However, it includes
x86 32-bit, x86_64, and ARM 32-bit and 64-bit (aarch64) executables,
and the appropriate one will be used based on the ARCH variable. The
aarch64 binary has been tested on SARPi 15.0 and appears to work OK.
The 32-bit ARM binary has not been tested; let me know if it works
for you.

Note to ARM users: there's no separate download for ARM or aarch64.
The .zip file includes binaries for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM.
