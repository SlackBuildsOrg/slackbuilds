Floorp is a fork of Firefox from Japan with a highly customizable UI and
better privacy and security defaults.

This is repackaged for Slackware from the official GitHub repository. 
It installs to /usr/lib64 by default (like Firefox) but you can 
install it anywhere you want with the INSTALLDIR variable.

Example: INSTALLDIR="/opt" ./floorp-bin.SlackBuild
