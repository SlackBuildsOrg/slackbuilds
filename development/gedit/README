gedit is the official text editor of the GNOME desktop
environment. While aiming at simplicity and ease of use, gedit is a
powerful general purpose text editor.

gspell is an optional (autodetected) dependency. If it's already
installed, but you don't want to build gedit with spell-checking
support, set the environment variable WITH_GSPELL to "no", e.g.
  WITH_GSPELL="no" ./gedit.SlackBuild
