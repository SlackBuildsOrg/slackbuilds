proj is a generic coordinate transformation software, that
transforms coordinates from one coordinate reference system (CRS) to
another. This includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic
transformations.

For datum grids, install the proj-data package. Without this package,
proj can fetch required grids from the internet as needed.
