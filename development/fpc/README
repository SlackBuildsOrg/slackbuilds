fpc (free pascal compiler)

Free Pascal (aka FPK Pascal) is a 32 and 64 bit professional Pascal
compiler.  It is available for different processors: Intel x86,
Amd64/x86_64, PowerPC, PowerPC64, Sparc, ARM. The discontinued 1.0
version also supports the Motorola 680x0. The following operating
systems are supported: Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X/Darwin, DOS, Win32,
Win64, WinCE, OS/2, Netware (libc and classic) and MorphOS.

The fpc source code is included by default. It is needed by
some applications (e.g Lazarus IDE) but it can be excluded with:

    SRC=no ./fpc.Slackbuild

Note: if you plan to use lazarus 3.0 make sure first to remove
any previous lazarus installation, then upgrade fpc to
version 3.2.2 build 3, and only then install lazarus 3.0
