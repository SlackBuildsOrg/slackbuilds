nsca-ng (NSCA-ng is a drop-in replacement for NSCA)

NSCA-ng provides a client-server pair which makes the command pipe
accessible to remote systems. This allows for submitting passive check
results, downtimes and many other commands to Nagios or Icinga.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
