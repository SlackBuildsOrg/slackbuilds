RapidCheck is a C++ framework for property based testing inspired by
QuickCheck. In this testing, you define properties your code should
always satisfy given certain conditions. RapidCheck generates random
test data to find cases where the property fails.
If it finds a failure, it minimizes the input to the smallest failing
case and displays it as a counterexample.
