gtklock-userinfo-module (adding user info to the lockscreen)

gtklock is a lockscreen based on gtkgreet. It uses the
wlr-layer-shell and wlr-input-inhibitor Wayland protocols. Works on
sway and other wlroots-based compositors.

NOTE:
This modules user defined display is configured by the 'mugshot'
application. Change any personal information or icon file within
'mugshot' first in order for the gtklock module to show that info
on the lockscreen.
