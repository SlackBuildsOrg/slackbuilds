Reference implementation of SLIP-0039: Shamir's Secret-Sharing for
Mnemonic Codes

This SLIP describes a standard and interoperable implementation of 
Shamirâ€™s secret sharing (SSS). SSS splits a secret into unique parts 
which can be distributed among participants, and requires a specified
minimum number of parts to be supplied in order to reconstruct the
original secret. Knowledge of fewer than the required number of parts
does not leak information about the secret.
