Fast and direct geospatial raster I/O for Python programmers who use
Numpy.

This package is aimed at developers who want little more than to read
raster images into Numpy arrays or buffers, operate on them in Python
(or Cython), and write the results out to new GeoTIFF files.

Rasterio employs GDAL under the hood for file I/O and raster
formatting.

Optional dependencies: boto3.
