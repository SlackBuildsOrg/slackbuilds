# 20200619 bkw: 14.2's creaky old bash 4.3 doesn't support
# inherit_errexit, which is a feature of bash 4.4 and up. The sed
# command below allows the script to run without it, which will change
# some of the error handling a bit, but won't actually break anything
# when there *aren't* errors. Previous versions of podget got along just
# fine without inherit_errexit...
# 20201103 bkw: upstream added checking code, this had to change some.
