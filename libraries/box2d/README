Box2D is a 2D rigid body simulation library for games.
Programmers can use it in their games to make objects
move in realistic ways and make the game world more
interactive.
From the game engine's point of view, a physics engine
is a system for procedural animation.

Box2D also provides many collision routines that can be
used even when rigid body simulation is not used.
There are functions for overlap and cast queries.

There is also a bounding volume hierarchy (dynamic tree)
that can be used for game specific spatial sorting needs.

Box2D is written in portable C17. Most of the types
defined in the engine begin with the b2 prefix.
