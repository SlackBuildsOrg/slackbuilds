freeplane (Mind Mapping, Knowledge Management, Project Management)

Freeplane is a free and open source software application that supports
thinking, sharing information, getting things done at work, in school
and at home. It provides you a set of tools for mind mapping (also
known as concept mapping or information mapping) and navigating the
mapped information. Freeplane's capabilities will appeal to power
users, but for the typical user is also a more robust alternative
to Xmind, Mindmeister, and similar mind mapping software.
