tnfs-fuse (client for trivial network filesystem)

TNFS is a simplified Internet file transfer protocol, designed for
limited resource usage and ease of implementation on small systems,
such as 8-bit computers. It's simpler than NFS, SMB, or FTP. It's
similar to TFTP, but has features TFTP lacks.

This package is the Linux (and Mac, *BSD, etc) client.

**Note**, the **correct** syntax for mounting a TNFS server with
tnfs-fuse is:

  tnfs-fuse -o address=hostname directory/

*Do not* forget and say "tnfs-fuse hostname directory". You won't
get an error message at mount time, but you'll get "invalid argument"
errors when you try to access the mounted directory. This will drive
you insane.
