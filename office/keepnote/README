KeepNote is a note taking application.

With KeepNote, you can store your class notes, TODO lists, research
notes, journal entries, paper outlines, etc in a simple notebook
hierarchy with rich-text formatting, images, and more. Using full-text
search, you can retrieve any note for later reference.

To use spell checking (optional), you will need python-gnome2-extras.
