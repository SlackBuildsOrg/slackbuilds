uni2ascii (convert UTF-8 into 7-bit ASCII and vice versa)

uni2ascii provides conversion in both directions between UTF-8 Unicode
and more than thirty 7-bit ASCII equivalents, including HTML numeric
character references, various escapes and hexadecimal. Such ASCII
equivalents are useful when including Unicode text in program source,
when debugging, and when entering text into web programs that can
handle the Unicode character set but are not 8-bit safe.
