We’ve all done it. In the process of writing a brand new application
we’ve discovered that we need a little bit of code that we’ve
invented before. Perhaps it’s something to handle unicode text.
Perhaps it’s something to make a bit of python-2.5 code run on
python-2.3. Whatever it is, it ends up being a tiny bit of code that
seems too small to worry about pushing into its own module so it sits
there, a part of your current project, waiting to be cut and pasted
into your next project. And the next. And the next. And since that
little bittybit of code proved so useful to you, it’s highly likely
that it proved useful to someone else as well. Useful enough that
they’ve written it and copy and pasted it over and over into each of
their new projects.

Well, no longer! Kitchen aims to pull these small snippets of code
into a few python modules which you can import and use within your
project.
No more copy and paste! Now you can let someone else maintain and
release these small snippets so that you can get on with your life.
