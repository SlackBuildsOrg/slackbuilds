# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

watchdog: watchdog is a daemon that periodically pokes a hardware chip,
watchdog: and if it fails to do so (presumaby because the system got stuck),
watchdog: the chip would reboot the system. A somehow working software
watchdog: emulation of this chip, called "softdog" also exists in Linux.
watchdog: A reboot can be triggered by some other criteria too.
