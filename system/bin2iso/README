bin2iso (BIN/CUE to ISO/WAV converter)

bin2iso converts raw format (.bin/.cue) CD image files to ISO-9660 or
.wav format. It's also (sometimes) capable of creating a .cue file for
a .bin file whose .cue file has gone missong.

There is no man page or --help option; run 'bin2iso' with no arguments
for usage.
