cgit is a web interface (cgi) for git repositories, written in C.

The folder /var/cache/cgit, must be owned by your webserver user.

A sample /etc/cgitrc (you must provide one) is in the docs folder,
and so are some example configuration files for apache and lighttpd.

Optional dependencies: For avatar support, install lua (or lua51, or
luajit) and lua-md5. cgit will search for luajit, lua, lua51 in that
order, and use the first one it finds; if none exist, it will build
without lua support. The slack-desc will show which lua package it
used, if any.

If you want to use the email-libravatar-korg.lua filter or the
email-gravatar-sbo.lua one, have a look also to the suggested css
additions (in the docs folder).
