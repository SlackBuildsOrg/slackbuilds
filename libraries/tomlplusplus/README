toml++ is a Header-only TOML config file parser and serializer for
C++17. TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy
to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously
to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into data structures in a
wide variety of languages.
