wxPython4 (Crossplatform GUI Toolkit)

wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python programming
language.  It allows Python programmers to create programs with a
robust, highly functional graphical user interface, simply and easily.

It is implemented as a set of Python extension modules that wrap the
GUI components of the popular wxWidgets cross platform library, which
is written in C++.

wxPython is a cross-platform toolkit. This means that the same program
will run on multiple platforms without modification.

Currently Supported platforms are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X
and macOS, and Linux or other unix-like systems with GTK2 or GTK3
libraries. In most cases the native widgets are used on each platform
to provide a 100% native look and feel for the application.
