ircd-hybrid (A lightweight, high-performance IRC daemon)

ircd is the server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay Chat
Program. The ircd is a server in that its function is to "serve" the
client program irc and other compatible programs with messages and
commands. All commands and user messages are passed directly to the
ircd for processing and relaying to other IRC servers.

This is ircd-hybrid, the highly modified (and hopefully improved)
variant of the original ircd program by Jarkko Oikarinen.

Groupname and Username

You must have the "ircd" group and user to run this script, for example:

  groupadd -g 360 ircd
  useradd -u 360 -s /bin/false -d /var/empty -g ircd ircd
