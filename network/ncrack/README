Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was
built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing
all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. Security
professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack
was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar
to Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour based
on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale
auditing of multiple hosts.

Ncrack's features include a very flexible interface granting the user
full control of network operations, allowing for very sophisticated
bruteforcing attacks, timing templates for ease of use, runtime
interaction similar to Nmap's and many more. Protocols supported
include RDP, SSH, HTTP(S), SMB, POP3(S), VNC, FTP, SIP, Redis,
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Telnet.
