# Slackware build script for xu4

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20230712 bkw: update for v1.3.

# 20230112 bkw: update for v1.2.1, after ~9 years there's a release!
# - no more disable_alt_x.diff, it works properly now.
# - always include the upgrade (u4upgrad.zip), since upstream does.
# - new dependencies boron and faun.
# - update man page and rename it u4 => xu4.
# - rework profile_path.diff.
# - update README and README-SBo.txt (remove obsolete info, add section
#   on running without pulse).
# - TODO: test with the GoG release (someone has to create a GoG account,
#   even though it's free-of-charge, and I'm not able to).

# 20211012 bkw: BUILD=3,
# - new-style icon.
# - binary in /usr/games.
# - man page in section 6.
# - disable Alt-x keystroke (it crashes the game).
# - "Press Alt-x to quit" => "Close window to quit".
