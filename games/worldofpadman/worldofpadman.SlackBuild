# 20220427 bkw: Modified by SlackBuilds.org, BUILD=2:
# - don't install both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries (rm the ones
#   not needed for the current ARCH).
# - don't install windows .ico or mac .icns icons.
# - new-style icons (multiple sizes, plus scalable).
# - wrapper executables in /usr/games, so people can launch them
#   from the command line without knowing the full path in /opt.
# - fix .desktop file (this isn't a Qt nor KDE app).
