Bharathi Pusthakaalayam in collaboration with Chalkpiece foundation
released the Bharathi Azhagu Tamil Unicode fonts totaling 808
fonts. This is my own personal selection of 77 fonts for
Slackware linux. The fonts are licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0

I have classified the fonts under these catagories
doc,reading,condensed and handwritten. By default only
the fonts under doc directory containing 25 fonts will be
installed.These fonts are for writing documents and looks good
especially typeset using lualatex as compared to using
libreoffice.

The fonts in reading dir are for viewing webpages it contains
a total of 38 fonts.To install the fonts in reading dir
run the slackbuild as

READING=YES ./fonts-tamil-bharathi.SlackBuild

The fonts in condensed folder are either monospace or typewritter
style like fonts and are very condensed containing a total of 7
fonts. To install these fonts run the slackbuild as

CONDENSED=YES ./fonts-tamil-bharathi.SlackBuild

The fonts in handwritten folder are in handwritten style containing
a total of 7 fonts. To install these fonts run the slackbuild as

HANDWRITTEN=YES ./fonts-tamil-bharathi.SlackBuild

If you use these fonts for viewing webpages then make
sure the font size is  atleast 20 otherwise it would be
too small to read.
