Developer's Image Library (DevIL), formerly called OpenIL, is a
programmer's library to develop applications with very powerful
image loading capabilities, yet is easy for a developer to learn
and use. Ultimate control of images is left to the developer, so
unnecessary conversions, etc. are not performed.  DevIL utilizes
a simple, yet powerful, syntax. DevIL can load, save, convert,
manipulate, filter and display a wide variety of image formats.

Currently, DevIL can load .bmp, .cut, .dds, .doom, .gif, .ico, .jpg,
.lbm, .mdl, .mng, .pal, .pbm, .pcd, .pcx, .pgm, .pic, .png, .ppm,
.psd, .psp, .raw, .sgi, .tga and .tif .hdr files.

Formats supported for saving include .bmp, .dds, .h, .jpg, .pal, .pbm,
.pcx, .hdr, .pgm, .png, .ppm, .raw, .sgi, .tga and .tif.

DevIL currently supports the following APIs for display: OpenGL,
Windows GDI, SDL, DirectX and Allegro. Compilers that can compile
DevIL or use it include Djgpp, MSVC++, Linux gcc, Delphi, Visual
Basic, Power Basic and Dev-C++.
