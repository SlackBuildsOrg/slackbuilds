OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared
towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects
and computer animation. OCIO provides a straightforward and
consistent user experience across all supporting applications while
allowing for sophisticated back-end configuration options suitable
for high-end production usage. OCIO is compatible with the Academy
Color Encoding Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic,
supporting many popular formats.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. YMMV on whether
this is a good idea.

Note to 32-bit users: this requires the SSE2 extension. If you
get "illegal instruction" errors at runtime, your CPU doesn't have
SSE2. At this point (2022), there aren't that many non-SSE2 x86 CPUs
still in service, so probably this won't be a problem for you.
