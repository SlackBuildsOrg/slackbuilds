Remote desktop daemon for GNOME using pipewire, allowing you to connect
to your machine remotely.

Note: On Slackware the gnome-remote-desktop daemon must be started and
stopped manually. There are controls to start/stop the daemon in the
gnome-control-center "Sharing" panel, but these controls are hard-coded
to talk to systemd and will not start/stop the daemon. Instead, the 
daemon can be run directly from its installed path of:

 /usr/libexec/gnome-remote-desktop
