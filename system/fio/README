fio is a tool that will spawn a number of threads or processes doing a
particular type of io action as specified by the user. fio takes a
number of global parameters, each inherited by the thread unless
otherwise parameters given to them overriding that setting is given.
The typical use of fio is to write a job file matching the io load
one wants to simulate.

To build the fio GUI, pass GUI=yes to the SlackBuild script:

# GUI=yes sh fio.SlackBuild

Example Usage:

This process runs a random read and write of two 128MB files created
during execution of fio.

$ fio --name=global --rw=randread --size=128m --name=job1 --name=job2
