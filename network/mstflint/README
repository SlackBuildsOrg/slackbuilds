The mstflint is a set of tools for changing firmware configuration of
Mellanox ConnectX Ethernet NICs and Infiniband HCA/VPI cards,
as well as diagnosing (mainly hardware) problems and
burning firmware for these products.

These open-source tools are based on a subset of the proprietary
Mellanox Firmware Tools (MFT) package.

The functionality needed to burn firmware for
Mellanox Infiniband switches from a connected host can be enabled with:

    env ENABLE_INBAND=YES ./mstflint.SlackBuild

which then pulls in the optional dependency upon "rdma-core"
(available on SlackBuilds.org).
