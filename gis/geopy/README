geopy makes it easy for developers to locate the coordinates of 
addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using 
third-party geocoders and other data sources.

geopy currently includes support for several geocoders, including 
OpenStreetMap Nominatim, ESRI ArcGIS, Google Geocoding API and more.

pytz and python3-aiohttp are optional dependencies that 
will be used if available.
