Idle3-tools provides a linux/unix utility that can disable, get and
set the value of the infamous idle3 timer found on recent Western
Digital Hard Disk Drives.

It can be used as an alternative to the official wdidle3.exe proprietary
utility, without the need to reboot in a DOS environement.

A power off/on cycle of the drive will still be mandatory for new
settings to be taken into account.

Modern Western Digital "Green" Drives include the Intellipark feature
that stops the disk when not in use. Unfortunately, the default timer
setting is not perfect on linux/unix systems, including many NAS,
and leads to a dramatic increase of the Load Cycle Count value (SMART
attribute #193).

Idle3-tools is an independant project, unrelated in any way to 
Western Digital Corp.

ACCESSES LOW LEVEL INFORMATION OF YOUR HARDDRIVE. USE AT YOUR OWN
