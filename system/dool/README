Dool is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, netstat, nfsstat
and ifstat. Dool overcomes some of their limitations and adds some
extra features, more counters and flexibility. Dool is handy for
monitoring systems during performance tuning tests, benchmarks or
troubleshooting. It can be easily extended with Python plugins for
almost any kind of system monitoring.

Dool is the drop-in replacement for dstat, after dstat development was
discontinued.
