Open vSwitch is a multilayer software switch licensed under the open
source Apache 2 license. The goal is to implement a production quality
switch platform that supports standard management interfaces and opens
the forwarding functions to programmatic extension and control.

Open vSwitch is well suited to function as a virtual switch in VM
environments. In addition to exposing standard control and visibility
interfaces to the virtual networking layer, it was designed to
support distribution across multiple physical servers. Open vSwitch
supports multiple Linux-based virtualization technologies including
Xen/XenServer, KVM, and VirtualBox.

Note: This package builds only the Open vSwitch userspace
utilities, and it is incompatible with 'openvswitch' package found on
SlackBuilds.org website. The stock Slackware kernel has been shipping
Open vSwitch support for a while now, and these utilities take this
advantage into account while providing a different approach to Open
vSwitch management.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
