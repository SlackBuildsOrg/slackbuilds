Important Application Changes
---------------------

The yt-dlp GUI supported in Videomass up to v5.0.26 is been
dropped and moved to a separate project called Vidtuber:

If you are interested, Vidtuber provides exactly the same GUI,
including the same features developed to date for Videomass,
but will also be more user-friendly.
