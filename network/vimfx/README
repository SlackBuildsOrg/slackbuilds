VimFx is a Firefox extension which adds short, Vim-style keyboard
shortcuts for browsing and navigation, for a near mouseless
experience.

One of key tenets of VimFx is that the standard Firefox features are
always preferable to re-implementing similar functionality.

VimFx is a legacy extension as opposite to WebExtensions. It works on
modern versions of Firefox thanks to a shim called LegacyFox, which is
also included in this script. Unlike WebExtensions this legacy one
works on incompletely loaded, blank, and system pages.

This script will install VimFx for all users on the system. When
starting Firefox, users will see a yellow warning triangle above the
hamburger menu (a button with three horizontal lines) and will be
prompted to activate the extension.

README.SBo contains details on building the package for a Firefox
different from the stock Slackware mozilla-firefox.
