python3-wheel (A built-package format for Python)

This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel
packaging standard, as defined in PEP 427.

Optional dependencies: python-keyring

NOTE: newer versions have a requirement for "packaging >= 24.0".  This
      would require modifying every dependee script to use *-opt
      packages.  If a newer version is needed I will look at this
      again. (same as python3-build)
