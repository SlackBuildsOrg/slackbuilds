OpenSCAD is CAD software for creating solid 3D objects. It is not an
interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a 3D-compiler that
reads in a script file that describes an object and renders the 3D
model from the script file.

The optional lib3mf package available at SBo is autodetected during
configuration, adding 3MF format import/export capability to OpenSCAD.
