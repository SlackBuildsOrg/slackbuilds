zabbix_agentd is the Linux agent daemon used to monitor Linux boxes
and send the data to the zabbix server.

Zabbix offers advanced monitoring, alerting and visualization
features, including distributed monitoring, auto-discovery,
notifications, etcetera.

zabbix_agentd needs to run under its own user/group. This has been
assigned to the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change
it on your system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbixagent       UID: 266        GID: 266
  group:  zabbixagent                       GID: 266

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXAGENTUSER and ZABBIXAGENTGROUP variables when running the build
script.

zabbix_agentd needs another user/group to cooperate with other Zabbix
deamons, like zabbix_server or zabbix_proxy. This has been assigned to
the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change it on your
system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbix            UID: 228        GID: 228
  group:  zabbix                            GID: 228

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXUSER and ZABBIXGROUP variables when running the build script.
