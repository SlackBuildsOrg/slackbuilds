The Tibetan script is a segmental writing system (abugida) 
of Indic origin used to write certain Tibetic languages, 
including Tibetan, Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, Jirel and Balti. 
It has also been used for some non-Tibetic languages in 
close cultural contact with Tibet, such as Thakali and Old Turkic.
The printed form is called uchen script while the hand-written 
cursive form used in everyday writing is called umÃª script.
