ueberzugpp (drop in replacement for ueberzug written in C++)

Ãœberzug++ is a command line utility written in C++ which allows to
draw images on terminals by using X11 child windows, sixels or the
kitty image protocol.

This project intends to be a drop-in replacement for the now
defunct ueberzug project (https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug).

NOTE: Do not install at the same time with "ueberzug" package!
      Both provide /usr/bin/ueberzug.
