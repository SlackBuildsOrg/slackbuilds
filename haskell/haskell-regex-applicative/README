regex-applicative is a Haskell library for parsing using regular
expressions. Parsers can be built using Applicative interface.

Perl programmers often use regular expressions for parsing, even if
it is not an appropriate tool for the job, because Perl has so good
support for regexps.

The opposite seems to be valid about Haskell programmers -- they
use parsing combinators (which recognize context-free or even
context-sensitive grammars), even when the language is actually
regular!

Hopefully, this library will improve the situation.
