GoTTY is a simple command line tool that turns
your CLI tools into web applications.

Config File
You can customize default options and your terminal (hterm)
by providing a config file to the gotty command. GoTTY loads
a profile file at ~/.gotty by default when it exists.

See the .gotty file in this repository for the list of
configuration options.
