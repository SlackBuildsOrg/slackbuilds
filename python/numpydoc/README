Sphinx extension to support docstrings in Numpy format.
Numpy's documentation uses several custom extensions to Sphinx. 
These are shipped in this numpydoc package, in case you want to 
make use of them in third-party projects.

numpydoc 1.6.0 is the last available version for Slackware 15.0. Newer
versions require Sphinx >= 6.
