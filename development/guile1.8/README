Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions.

Guile is an interpreter for Scheme, packaged as a library that you
can link into your applications to give them their own scripting
language. Guile will eventually support other languages as well,
giving users of Guile-based applications a choice of languages.

This is Guile 1.8 (legacy version) needed by some packages in SBo.

This package can be installed alongside with Slackware's Guile

This SlackBuild accepts the NO_DOCS=true option, in case
documentation is not needed, and/or if the build fails.
