lua-readline (lua interface to the readline and history libraries)

This Lua module offers a simple calling interface to the GNU Readline
and History libraries.

Optional dependencies:

- lua-posix: if this is installed, lua-readline can use it at runtime
  to determine the user's home directory, if HOME is not set in the
  environment.

- lua51: if this is installed when the package is built, lua-readline
  will include a module for Lua 5.1.
