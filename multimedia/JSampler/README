A graphical frontend for LinuxSampler.

This build script assumes you have some JDK installed, and that
$JAVA_HOME is properly set for the root user during the build process.

Any JDK distributed on SlackBuilds.org includes a configuration file to
set JAVA_HOME.

The default is zulu-openjdk8.
If you want to use a different JDK, then you must manually specify it.
For example, suppose you've installed jdk23 and want to use it:

# JDK=jdk23 ./JSampler.SlackBuild
