Tdlib is the official Telegram library for the Telegram protocol.
It can be used to implement unofficial Telegram clients.

In particular, it is required for the Emacs package telega.el to
work.

NOTE: the build uses a commit, but the version is accurate. The
reason is that although tdlib developers designate versions, they
do not write them in github tags.
