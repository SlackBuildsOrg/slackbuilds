Moria/UMoria is a single player roguelike game with a regenerating 
dungeon. moria is the predecessor of angband with a full-screen, 
text-based, turn-based interface.  It features scrolling maps, and 
an infinite (constantly regenerated) dungeon. 

Moria's dungeons are populated by monsters, some of which are 
inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's books.  The goal of the game is to 
find and kill the Balrog, whereupon the player is crowned King.  
Your player can be created from a combination of 8 races (human, 
half-elf, elf, halfling, gnome, dwarf, half-orc, half-troll) and 
6 classes (warrior, mage, priest, rogue, ranger, paladin), and is 
measured by 6 attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, 
wisdom, constitution, and charisma).
