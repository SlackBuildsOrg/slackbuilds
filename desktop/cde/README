The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) was the dominant desktop on 
proprietary Unix systems in the 90's. In 2012 it was relicensed under 
GPL2 and has seen moderst maintenance from the community. Although
functional, it is of course a very old desktop, and some parts of it,
such as the calendar and mail applications are not likely useful in a 
modern setting. (there are security considerations too) Nevertheless,
people still use it today, for nostalgia, if nothing else.

PS: The package enables the /etc/rc.d/rc.rpc service.
