Haxe is an open source high-level strictly-typed programming language
with a fast optimizing cross-compiler.

Haxe can build cross-platform applications targeting JavaScript,
C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash, and allows access to each
platform's native capabilities. Haxe has its own VMs (HashLink and
NekoVM) but can also run in interpreted mode.

Code written in Haxe can be compiled to any target Haxe supports.

This is a repackaging of the official binary distribution.
