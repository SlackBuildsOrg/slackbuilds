The Hessling Editor (THE) is a powerful text editor modeled on the
VM/CMS text editor XEDIT with the best features of
Mansfield Software's Kedit.

THE uses Regina Rexx as its macro language. It uses a command line,
key bindings and a prefix area to operate.


Optional Dependency

If PDCurses is installed then the X11 version of the program (xthe)
will be created.
