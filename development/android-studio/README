Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Android Studio is the official integrated development environment
for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ
IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It
is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating
systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools
as primary IDE for native Android application development.
