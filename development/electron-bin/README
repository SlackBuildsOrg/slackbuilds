electron-bin: THIS PACKAGE CONFLICT WITH "electron"

This is electron binary repackaged in Slackware style. This SlackBuild
is for latest stable version of Electron for arch x86_64.

Optional features

INSTALL_ZIP (default=no): Install zip packaged version of electron,
this install a copy of the zip in your system; you can use it later
for build binary applications, if you are developer; otherwise
you not will need it.

If you need to use the option 'INSTALL_ZIP' do something like:

INSTALL_ZIP=yes ./electron-bin.SlackBuild

You can see README.Slackware for more instructions to use it.
