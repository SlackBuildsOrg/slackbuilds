tint (tetris clone for the terminal)

TINT Is Not Tetris

As the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game.

The game is as close to the original as possible, but there are a few
differences. Nevertheless, it's probably the closest to the original
that you'll ever find in the UNIX world.

The game runs in a terminal, and is controlled by the keyboard.

This build patches the code:
- up arrow rotates the piece instead of speeding up the game.
- capital (shifted) letters are accepted for S/D/A/P/Q.

If you *really* don't like the idea of patching the code, set
PRISTINE=yes in the script's environment to build without patching.
