# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

uwm: uwm (the ultimate window manager)
uwm:
uwm: UWM, also known as UDE (The Unix Desktop Environment), is a minimal
uwm: window manager with very few dependencies and a rather unique GUI.
uwm: The name is somewhat of a misnomer though, it has no direct bearing
uwm: on Unix and shouldn't be confused with the Ultrix Window Manager. The
uwm: package does not include a manpage, but there is a PDF manual in
uwm: /usr/doc/uwm-* that new users will find helpful.
