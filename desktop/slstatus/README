slstatus

slstatus is a status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
or stdin to fill the status bar.

This SlackBuild ships with a minimal example config.h file.
If a config.h is found in the SlackBuild directory, it will be copied
to the source directory and used in the build, allowing easy
customisation.
