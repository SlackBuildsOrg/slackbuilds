This is the kernel-module needed by the proprietary binary nvidia
driver.  You also need the nvidia-driver package from SlackBuilds.org.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
    KERNEL=4.6.3 ./nvidia-legacy470-kernel.SlackBuild

The xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist package from /extra is required.

The Nvidia 470.xx series is EOL as of September 2024.

NOTE: The CURRENT= and all other KERNELxxx= flags have been removed;
the script now figures out the kernel version automatically and
patches accordingly.
