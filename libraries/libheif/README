libheif is an ISO/IEC 23008-12:2017 HEIF and AVIF (AV1 Image File
Format) file format decoder and encoder. There is partial support for
ISO/IEC 23008-12:2022 (2nd Edition) capabilities.

HEIF and AVIF are new image file formats employing HEVC (h.265) or AV1
image coding, respectively, for the best compression ratios currently
possible. HEIF is the default image file format on Apple devices. This
library comes with some example programs including heif-convert that
converts HEIF/AVIF images to JPEG or PNG.

libheif makes use of libde265 for HEIF image decoding and x265 for
encoding. For AVIF, aom, dav1d, svt-av1, or rav1e are used as codecs.
