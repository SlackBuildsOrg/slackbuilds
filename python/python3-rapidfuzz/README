python3-rapidfuzz (Rapid fuzzy string matching)

RapidFuzz is a fast string matching library for Python and C++,
which is using the string similarity calculations from FuzzyWuzzy.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 1.9.1 due to requiring a
newer Cython than included in Slackware (needs 3.0.9).
