Net::Write - a portable interface to open and send raw data to network

Net::Write provides a portable interface to open a network interface,
and be able to write raw data directly to the network. It juste
provides three methods when a Net::Write object has been created for
an interface: open, send, close.

It is possible to open a network interface to send frames at layer 2
(you craft a frame from link layer), or at layer 3 (you craft a frame
from network layer), or at layer 4 (you craft a frame from transport
layer).
