Genjyuu Gothic (源柔ゴシック, Genjū Gosshikku) is a derivative 
font that takes the free OpenType font 
Source Han Sans (Noto Sans CJK / 源ノ角ゴシック), converts it 
to the TrueType format, and applies a process to round its 
corners, giving it the appearance of a rounded gothic font.
Both proportional and monospaced families are provided.
This is a repackage of the font for Slackware Linux.
