python3-llvmlite (Lightweight LLVM python binding)

llvmlite is a project originally tailored for Numba's needs, using the
following approach:

-A small C wrapper around the parts of the LLVM C++ API we need that
are not already exposed by the LLVM C API.
-A ctypes Python wrapper around the C API.
-A pure Python implementation of the subset of the LLVM IR builder that
we need for Numba.
