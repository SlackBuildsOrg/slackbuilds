The unixODBC Project goals are to develop and promote unixODBC to be
the definitive standard for ODBC on non MS Windows platforms.  This is
to include GUI support for both KDE and GNOME.  ODBC is an open
specification for providing application developers with a predictable
API with which to access Data Sources.  Data Sources include SQL
Servers and any Data Source with an ODBC Driver.

This will be compiled without GUI support.  If you want to give it
a try, edit the build script and comment out the "--disable-gui"
configure argument.

Also, there is a seperate GUI frontend available separately from:
http://www.unixodbc.org/gui/

NOTE: This package conflicts with libiodbc in Slackware. Make sure to
reinstall libiodbc if you remove this package.
