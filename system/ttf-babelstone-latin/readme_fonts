ttf-babelstone-latin contains the following fonts

BabelStone Roman:

It is a Unicode serif font covering the Latin script.
It was designed primarily for use in phonetic
transcription of Tangut, but may be useful for
other purposes. he current version of the font supports
Unicode 15.0 and covers all 1,481 Latin script
characters defined in Unicode 15.0.

BabelStone Englisc:

It is a font for Old English in the general style of
the Anglo-Saxon font cut for Franciscus Junius (1591â€“1677)
in about 1655, and used in various editions of Anglo-Saxon
texts published in Oxford during the 17th and 18th centuries,
for example the Anglo-Saxon Heptateuch compiled by Edward
Thwaites, and published in 1698. The font uses the same
letterforms as the Junius font, but not necessarily exactly
same glyph forms. Some characters are double-mapped, both to
their proper Unicode code point and to the
semantically-corresponding character
(e.g. 'wynn' maps to 'wynn' and 'w'; and 'and' maps
to 'tyronian et' and 'ampersand').

NB: This font is only available in regular style, and
there are no bold or italic versions.

BabelStone Goblin fonts:

BabelStone Goblin and BabelStone Goblin Vertical are two
versions of a font based on North Polar Bear's Goblin
alphabet in J. R. R. Tolkien's Father Christmas Letters (1976).

BabelStone Goblin is designed for horizontal layout, whereas
BabelStone Goblin Vertical is designed for vertical layout.
Note that the glyphs of the vertical font will be rotated
counterclockwise with respect to normal reading orientation
when used in horizontal contexts

BabelStone Centaurian:

BabelStone Centaurian is a font based on the Centaurian
alphabet used in the first UK edition of Artemis Fowl :
The Arctic Incident by Eoin Colfer (it has been replaced
by the ubiquitous Gnommish script in the American and
recent UK editions).

The Centaurian alphabet is cypher of the English alphabet,
but with the twist that the space character is a
non-blank glyph and the character corresponding to the letter
T is a blank space.

BabelStone Pigpen fonts:

BabelStone Pigpen is an extended version of one of the most
common pigpen ciphers, with glyphs for all characters in the
Basic Latin block.

BabelStone Club Penguin is an extended version of the
pigpen cipher used on Club Penguin, with glyphs for all
characters in the Basic Latin block.

BabelStone Leeson is the pigpen cipher used on the tombstone
of James Leeson (died 1794) in the graveyard of Trinity Church
on Broadway in New York. This cipher represents the 24-letter
alphabet of the 18th century, so that I/J and U/V are not
distinguished. There are three spare berths in the third pigpen,
which I have assigned to ampersand, question mark and exclamation mark.
