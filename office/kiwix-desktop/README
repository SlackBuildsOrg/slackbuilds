Kiwix Desktop (Kiwix desktop application)

Kiwix is an offline reader - meaning that it allows you to check text
or video that is normally only available on the Internet.

We turn various online educational contents (such as Wikipedia, for
example) into ZIM files, and these can be opened by Kiwix even if you
have no connectivity whatsoever.The Kiwix Desktop is a viewer/manager
of ZIM files for GNU/Linux.
