# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-versioneer: python3-versioneer (Easy VCS-based mgt of project version strings)
python3-versioneer:
python3-versioneer: This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in
python3-versioneer: setuptools-based python projects. The goal is to remove the tedious
python3-versioneer: and error-prone "update the embedded version string" step from your
python3-versioneer: release process. Making a new release should be as easy as recording a
python3-versioneer: new tag in your version-control system, and maybe making new tarballs
