# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

beautysh: Java programs - they have a lot of ambiguous syntax, and (shudder) you
beautysh: can use keywords as variables. This means there will be some border
beautysh: cases beautysh won't be able to process.
