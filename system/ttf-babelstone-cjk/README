Babelstone fonts is created by Andrew West. This package
contains the chinese fonts along with regional variants.
It covers Han,Jurchen,Khitan,Tangut,Sui,Naxi Dongba and Yi
scripts.It also covers Hanzi,Kanji and Hanja.

In this release I have moved fonts for scripts that are 
no longer used today apart from academia.

To install archaic fonts run the slackbuild as
archaic=yes ./ttf-babelstone-cjk.SlackBuild
