Driftnet is a program designed to capture JPEG and GIF images by
sniffing network traffic and display them in an X window.  Optionally,
you may also capture MPEG audio streams and play them.  According to
the author, "It is a horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be
used by anyone anywhere."

This is an updated version available from GitHub, which includes several
patches for use on newer systems.
