Hostsblock is a bash script for Linux designed to take advantage
of the /etc/hosts file to provide system-wide blocking of internet
advertisements, malicious domains, trackers, and other undesirable
content. To do so, it downloads a configurable set of blocklists and
processes and their entries into a singular file.

The SlackBuild assumes that dnsmasq is not available so it
will configure hostsblock to overwrite the current /etc/hosts
file. The install script will backup the current /etc/hosts file to
/etc/hostsblock/hosts.head if it does not already exist.

After uninstalling hostsblock, you should copy hosts.head back to
/etc/hosts.

To have hostsblock automatically update /etc/hosts once a week, run:
  ln -sf /usr/sbin/hostsblock /etc/cron.weekly/hostsblock
