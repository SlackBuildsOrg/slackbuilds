Cross-platform application for configuring any YubiKey over all USB
interfaces.

This application provides an easy way to perform the most common
configuration tasks on a YubiKey.

The current version can:
  - Display the serial number and firmware version of a YubiKey
  - Configure a FIDO2 PIN
  - Reset the FIDO Applications
  - Configure the OTP Application. A YubiKey have two slots (Short
    Touch and Long Touch), which may both be configured for different
    functionality. This tool can configure a Yubico OTP credential,
    a static password, a challenge-response credential or an OATH HOTP
    credential in both of these slots.
  - Manage certificates and PINs for the PIV Application
  - Swap the credentials between two configured slots
  - Enable and disable USB and NFC interfaces
