Rime is a modular, extensible input method engine in cross-platform
C++ code, built on top of open-source technologies, covering
features found in a large variety of Chinese input methods, either
shape-based or phonetic-based.

It is built with native support for Traditional Chinese, and converts
to Simplified Chinese and other regional standards via OpenCC.

Other features include:
- Rime input schema, a DSL in YAML syntax for quickly trying out
  innovative ideas of input method design
- Spelling Algebra, a mechanism to create variant spelling,
  especially useful for Chinese dialects
- Support for chord-typing with a generic Qwerty keyboard

This is the shared library for Rime. Logging and build testing are
disabled, and if you want to enable them:
- To enable logging, delete the line -DENABLE_LOGGING=OFF and install
  `glog` from SBo.
- To enable build testing, delete the line -DBUILD_TEST=OFF and
  install `gtest` from SBo.

Additionally you may want to use Plum, the Rime package manager, to
install and manage schemas. The plum script makes no sense to package,
but you can install it by following the install instructions at
<https://github.com/rime/plum>. For basic usage, run in a desired
directory:

  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rime/plum.git
  cd plum
  rime_frontend=fcitx5-rime bash rime-install :preset

After running this (and installing an appropriate frontend for RIME),
you'll have a basic Rime set up.
