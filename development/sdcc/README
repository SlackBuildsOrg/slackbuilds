SDCC is a retargettable, optimizing Standard C (ANSI C89, ISO C99, ISO
C11) compiler suite that targets the Intel MCS51 based microprocessors
(8031, 8032, 8051, 8052, etc.), Maxim (formerly Dallas) DS80C390
variants, Freescale (formerly Motorola) HC08 based (hc08, s08), Zilog
Z80 based MCUs (Z80, Z180, SM83, Rabbit 2000, 2000A, 3000A, TLCS-90),
Padauk (pdk14, pdk15) and STMicroelectronics STM8.  Work is in progress
on supporting the Padauk pdk13 and MOS 6502 targets; Microchip PIC16 and
PIC18 targets are unmaintained.  SDCC can be retargeted for other
microprocessors.

The documentation (SDCC manual) and support for PIC targets are disabled
by default because they require extra packages.  Enable them by passing
these variables to the script (VAR=yes|no ./sdcc.SlackBuild):

ENABLE_DOC=yes|no (default: no), requires lyx, latex2html
ENABLE_PIC=yes|no (default: no), requires gputils
