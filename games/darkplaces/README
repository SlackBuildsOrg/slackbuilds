darkplaces (crossplatform Quake modification)

DarkPlaces is a gameplay modification and a source port engine based
on the computer game Quake.  It adds enhanced network code, with
asynchronous delta compression, a built in server browser, real-time
lighting, and bump mapping.  It makes use of the OpenGL Shading
Language and supports Ogg Vorbis.

The application launcher will launch the OpenGL version of Quake,
however if you would prefer it to launch the SDL version then pass
SDL=yes to the build.

Also the darkplaces game modifications are disabled by default to
maintain that "classic" look of the original quake.  To enable the
modifications, pass DPMOD=yes to the build.

*NOTE* DarkPlaces is only a game engine modification; you still need the
original quake *.pak game files to play quake.  See README.SLACKWARE for
more information on this and information for adding high resolution 
textures for people with modern video cards.
