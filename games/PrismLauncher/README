PrismLauncher (An Open Source Minecraft launcher)

An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free
redistributability.

A Microsoft or Mojang account that owns Minecraft is required to
download and play the game through PrismLauncher.

zulu-openjdk17 can be used instead of OpenJDK17, if one wishes to do
so. Other versions of Java may be needed to run different versions of
Minecraft.

1.20.5 or newer: zulu-openjdk21
1.17 to 1.20.4:  OpenJDK17 or zulu-openjdk17
1.16 or older:   openjdk8 or zulu-openjdk8

If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your
system, make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointed
to OpenJDK17 when building PrismLauncher.
