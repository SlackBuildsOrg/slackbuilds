A Pluggable Terraform Linter

TFLint is a framework and each feature is provided by plugins, the
key features are as follows:

- Find possible errors (like invalid instance types) for Major Cloud
  providers (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Warn about deprecated syntax, unused declarations.
- Enforce best practices, naming conventions.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
