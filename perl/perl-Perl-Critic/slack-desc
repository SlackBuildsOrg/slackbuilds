# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Perl-Critic: perl-Perl-Critic (Critique Perl source code for best-practices.)
perl-Perl-Critic:
perl-Perl-Critic: Perl::Critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying
perl-Perl-Critic: coding standards to Perl source code. Essentially, it is a static
perl-Perl-Critic: source code analysis engine. Perl::Critic is distributed with a
perl-Perl-Critic: number of Perl::Critic::Policy modules that attempt to enforce
perl-Perl-Critic: various coding guidelines. Most Policy modules are based on Damian
perl-Perl-Critic: Conway's book Perl Best Practices. However, Perl::Critic is not
perl-Perl-Critic: limited to PBP and will even support Policies that contradict Conway.
perl-Perl-Critic: You can enable, disable, and customize those Polices through the
perl-Perl-Critic: Perl::Critic interface.
