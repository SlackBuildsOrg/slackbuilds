fceux is a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Famicom, and 
Famicom Disk System (FDS) emulator. It supports both PAL
(European) and NTSC (USA/JPN) modes. It supports both Windows
and SDL versions for cross compatibility.

Optional dependencies are x264 and x265

Lua 5.1.x is required for fceux, however it will use an internal 
version if not found during build. So it is optional but not 
nescessary to install Lua 5.1 for fceux to work.
