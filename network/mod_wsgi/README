mod_wsgi is a simple to use Apache module which can host any Python
application which supports the Python WSGI interface. The module
would be suitable for use in hosting high performance production web
sites as well as your average personal sites running on commodity web
hosting services.

All major Python web frameworks/applications support mod_wsgi,
including Django, Flask, Pyramid, TurboGears, ...

You'll need to add the following line to your /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
file:
  Include /etc/httpd/extra/mod_wsgi.conf

From version 4.2, mod_wsgi ships with additional helper program for
developers, mod_wsgi-express, which enables easier development and
debugging with mod_wsgi and Apache.

If you are a developer, you can enable the helper with:
  ENABLE_EXPRESS=1 ./mod_wsgi.SlackBuild

For express functionality you'll need to install 'pysetuptools' and
'mod-wsgi-metrics' (both available from SBo).
