# 20241003 bkw: update for v3.6.3.
# 20240917 bkw: update for v3.6.2.
# 20240909 bkw: update for v3.6.1.
# 20240812 bkw: update for v3.6.
# 20240313 bkw: update for v3.4.13.
# 20231101 bkw: update for v3.4.10.
# 20230918 bkw: update for v3.4.6, fix zsh completion.

# 20230818 bkw:
# - Update for v3.4.
# - Upstream includes a man page now, use it instead of Debian's.
# - Use sed instead of a patch, for privacy in the HTML files.
# - Move the .ini files to /usr/share/astyle.
# - Install the shell completions (new in 3.4).

# 20200113 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance.
# - Add man page and privacy patch, BUILD=2.
# - Get rid of "shared" from make command. We weren't installing the
#   shared library anyway, despite the comment above from Daniel
#   Jordan. The only thing that lists astyle as a dependency is ebe,
#   and that's a runtime dep (it executes the astyle command, doesn't
#   link the shared lib). If someone needs the shared lib, I can add
#   it to the build, but for now I'm leaving it alone because the
#   .so isn't versioned (upgrades may cause breakage).
# - Simplify and tweak the script.
