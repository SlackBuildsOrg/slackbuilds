Scala is a functional object-oriented programming language compiling to
JVM byte code.

This is a binary repackaging of the distribution from the Scala
home-page. It can be installed alongside the scala package in SBo.
The binaries are called scala3, scalac3 and scaladoc3.

The installation is like Java Runtime/SDK, in that it places everything
by default in /usr/lib/scala3.

The lib directory is set dependent upon the package architecture:
/usr/lib on x86 and /usr/lib64 on x86_64.
