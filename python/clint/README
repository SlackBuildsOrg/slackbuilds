Clint is awesome. Crazy awesome. It supports colors, but detects if
the session is a TTY, so doesn't render the colors if you're piping
stuff around.

Awesome nest-able indentation context manager. Example: (with
indent(4): puts ('indented text')). It supports custom email-style
quotes. Of course, it supports color too, if and when needed.

It has an awesome Column printer with optional auto-expanding
columns.  It detects how wide your current console is and adjusts
accordingly. It wraps your words properly to fit the column size. With
or without colors mixed in.  All with a single function call.

The world's easiest to use implicit argument system w/ chaining
methods for filtering. Seriously.
