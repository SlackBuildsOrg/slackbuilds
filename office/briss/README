BRISS aims to offer a simple cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX)
application for cropping PDF files. A simple user interface lets you
define exactly the crop-region by fitting a rectangle on the visually
overlaid pages. It's licensed under GPL.

To build the package and run this program a Java runtime environment
(JRE) is enough.
