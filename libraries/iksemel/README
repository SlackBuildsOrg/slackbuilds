iksemel (XML parser for Jabber apps)

iksemel is an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) parser library designed
for Jabber applications.

 * Highly portable, builds on all POSIX environments and Windows (via
   mingw).
 * Suitable for embedded systems. Code is small and highly modular,
   you can trim unneeded parts. Memory usage is low, parser is quite
   fast.
 * Provides SAX, DOM and XMPP parsers.
 * TLS (via gnutls) and SASL support for XMPP security.
 * Only UTF8 encoding is built-in supported.
 * Fully documented with examples. 

iksemel is a dependancy for the re_jabber and chan_gtalk modules when
building Asterisk.
