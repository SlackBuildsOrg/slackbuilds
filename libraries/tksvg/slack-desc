# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tksvg: tksvg (Tk support for SVG)
tksvg:
tksvg: This package adds support to read the SVG image format from Tk.
tksvg: The actual code to parse and raster the SVG comes from nanosvg.
tksvg: Note: this package is not required for Tk 8.7, as this functionality
tksvg: is included in the core. The package index file simulates a load on
tksvg: this version but actually does nothing.
