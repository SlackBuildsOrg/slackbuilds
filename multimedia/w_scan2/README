w_scan2 is a small channel scan tool which generates
ATSC, DVB-C, DVB-S/S2 and DVB-T/T2 channels.conf files.

It's based on the old "scan" tool from linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0

The differences are:
- no initial tuning data needed, because scanning without this data is
  exactly what a scan tool like this should do
- it detects automatically which DVB/ATSC card to use
- much more output formats, interfacing to other dtv software.

w_scan2 is a fork of the original w_scan
from https://www.gen2vdr.de/wirbel/w_scan/index2.html


adds optional LCN to channel names (channels.conf: mplayer/vdr/xine)
LCN=yes ./sage.SlackBuild
so that, if you want the channels sorted by LCN, you can run
w_scan2 -c IT -X | sort > channels.conf
