Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software
application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to make
internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a
graph. It is designed to help users organize and structure their
thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way.

The software is free for personal use, with commercial licenses
available for pay

This script repackages the Debian package provided by Obsidian team.

Currently, only the 64bit version is available.
