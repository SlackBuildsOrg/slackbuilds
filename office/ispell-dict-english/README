ispell-dict-english is a set of additional English dictionaries
for International Ispell.



1. British {small,medium,large}
2. American {small,large}
3. Alternative American (mostly double-l-words) {small,medium,large}

As Ispell is not recompiled, they will not appear in a call to
~ispell -vv~, but you can select them manually using:

ispell -d /usr/lib$LIBIDRSUFFIX/{american,british,altamer}\
{sml,med,xlg}.hash
