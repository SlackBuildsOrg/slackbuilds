wxCam is a webcam application for linux. It supports video recording
(in an avi uncompressed and Xvid format), snapshot taking, and some
special commands for philips webcams, so you can also use the program
for astronomy purposes. It supports both video4linux 1 and 2 drivers,
so it should work on a very large number of devices.
