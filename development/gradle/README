Gradle is build automation evolved.

Gradle can automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment and
more of software packages or other types of projects such as generated
static websites, generated documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to build.

Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a
declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults.
Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source
projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.

Excluding Documentation
-----------------------

If you would like to exclude the documentation in the generated package,
you can use the following command when building the package:

  # INCLUDE_DOCS=NO ./gradle.Slackbuild

Dependencies
------------

Gradle runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). A JVM version between 8 and
24 is required to execute Gradle.

In the link given below, you can find the java version supported by a
specific gradle release.

I have tested this using zulu-openjdk17.
