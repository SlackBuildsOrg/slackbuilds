google-earth (Google's famous virtual globe)

Google Earth Pro is a virtual globe program. It maps a version of the
Earth by the superimposition of images obtained from satellite 
imagery, aerial photography and GIS over a 3D globe. You point 
and zoom to any place on the planet that you want to explore.
Satellite images and local facts zoom into view. Tap into Google
search to show local points of interest and facts. Zoom to a 
specific address to check out an apartment or hotel. View driving
directions and even fly along your route.

The degree of resolution available is based somewhat on the points 
of interest, but most land (except for some islands) is covered in at
least 15 meters of resolution. 

NOTES:
1) Google Earth Pro requires that you have OpenGL drivers installed on
   your system (and Xorg configured to use them). Not doing so will
   cause X to crash.

2) This version of Google Earth Pro is only available for 64-bit
   systems.  If you are still running 32-bit, you will need the
   google-earth-legacy SBo script.
