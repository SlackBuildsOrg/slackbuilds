Radeon Open Compute platforM (ROCm) is a software stack, composed
primarily of open-source software, that provides the tools for
programming AMD Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), from low-level
kernels to high-level end-user applications.

Specifically, ROCm provides the tools for HIP (Heterogeneous-computing
Interface for Portability), OpenCL and OpenMP. These include compilers,
libraries for high-level functions, debuggers, profilers and runtimes.

This SlackBuild contains enough of the available ROCm components to
build the AMD-specific elements (including GPU access) of the set of
libraries required to build blender from source code. It therefore
targets the latest version in the 6.x.x series of available ROCm
components.

While the particular ROCm components chosen for this SlackBuild target
the libraries required to build blender, a further aim is for this
to become a more general toolkit for AMD GPU programming. Suggestions
are therefore welcome regarding additional ROCm components to include
in the SlackBuild (please email the maintainer).

This SlackBuild uses precompiled blobs downloaded from the repo at
radeon.com (much like the cudatoolkit* SlackBuilds which download and
rearrange a precompiled blob from nvidia.com). Building these
precompiled blobs from their source codes remains an exercise for the
future.

Building this SlackBuild will download nearly 4G of required files,
which will be repackaged to create the final Slackware package, which
will itself be nearly 3G (expanding to over 20G when installed).

This SlackBuild should not be installed at the same time as opencl-amd
(from the libraries category) with which it is likely to conflict.
