filebot (The ultimate TV and Movie Renamer)

FileBot is the ultimate tool for organizing and renaming your movies,
tv shows, anime, and music, as well as downloading subtitles and
artwork. It's smart and just works.

Many examples of renaming conventions, including automating renaming,
can be found on their website and forum.

If desired, zulu-openjdk11 can be substituted for any jdk v11 and
higher.

NOTE: This is no longer a free version. You need to purchase a license
to use this program. You can purchase a 1-year or lifetime license on
their website, https://www.filebot.net/. It is good for all platforms.

The free version is available on SBo under multimedia/filebot-legacy,
however, that version may have parts of it broken since it is no
longer maintained. Use at your own risk.
