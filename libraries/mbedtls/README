mbedtls (An open source, portable, easy to use TLS library)

Mbed TLS is a C library that implements cryptographic primitives,
X.509 certificate manipulation and the SSL/TLS and DTLS protocols. Its
small code footprint makes it suitable for embedded systems.

Mbed TLS includes a reference implementation of the PSA Cryptography
API. This is currently a preview for evaluation purposes only.
