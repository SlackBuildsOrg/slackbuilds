deskew (command line tool for automatically deskewing text images)

Deskew is a command line tool for deskewing scanned text documents. It
uses Hough transform to detect "text lines" in the image. As an output,
you get an image rotated so that the lines are horizontal.

There is no man page, but you can run deskew with no arguments to see
the list of supported options.
