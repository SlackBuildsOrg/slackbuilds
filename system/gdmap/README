GdMap is a tool which allows to visualize disk space. To display
directory structures cushion treemaps are used which visualize a
complete folder or even the whole hard drive with one picture. Cushion
treemaps display directories and files in rectangular areas. The
larger a file is the larger is the rectangle which represents it. All
files in one directory are painted within the rectangle of that
directory.
