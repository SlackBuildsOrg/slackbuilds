GridTracker2: An Amateur Radio Companion

GridTracker2 listens to traffic from WSJT-X/JTDX, displays it on a map,
and has a sophisticated alerting and filtering system for finding and
working interesting stations. It also will upload QSO records to
multiple logging frameworks including Logbook of the World.

GridTracker2 is supported on 64-bit only.  32-bit is unsupported.
