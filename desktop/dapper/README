dapper is a simple lightweight desktop application auto-starter. It will
read .desktop files in the autostart directories, all according to the
FreeDesktop autostart specifications.

You can define which desktop to start applications for (e.g. GNOME,
XFCE, etc) in configuration file (~/.config/dapper.conf) or from command
line.
