MDI Library enables code interoperability via the MolSSI Driver
Interface (MDI).

The MDI project, managed by the Molecular Sciences Software Institute,
provides a standardized API for fast, on-the-fly communication between
computational chemistry codes. This greatly simplifies the process of
implementing methods that require the cooperation of multiple software
packages and enables developers to write a single implementation that
works across many different codes.
