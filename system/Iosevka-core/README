Iosevka-core (minimal Iosevka font set)

Iosevka-core provides a minimal installation of the Iosevka monospace
font family, intended for common use cases such as terminals, text
editors, and lightweight graphical applications.

Only the following TTC files are installed:

  - Iosevka-Regular.ttc
  - Iosevka-Bold.ttc

These provide the Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic styles.
All other upstream weights and variants are intentionally omitted
to reduce disk usage.

WARNING
-------

This package conflicts with the full "Iosevka" package available at:

  https://slackbuilds.org/repository/15.0/system/Iosevka/

Both packages install files with the same names. Only one of them
should be installed at a time.
