Avogadro Application is the graphic user interface of Avogadro 2.

Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor designed for cross-platform 
use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, 
materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible rendering and 
a powerful plugin architecture. 

Managed by OpenChemistry, Avogadro 2 it is based on QT5 libraries and 
it is a rewrite of the old Avogadro 1.x.

By default the script builds avogadroapp with shared libraries. If you
want to enable the building with static libraries, pass the variable
SHARED=no to the script:

   SHARED=no ./avogadroapp.SlackBuild  (hdf5 required)   

Warning: the computational settings made through the Input Generator
require the MoleQueue server running to submit jobs to local
applications or remote HPC clusters.

Since Avogadro 2 version 1.98.0, the build requires cmake at version
3.24 or greater. This version is the latest compatible with Slackware
15.0 that has cmake remained at the version 3.21.
