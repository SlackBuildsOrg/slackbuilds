HDFView Software

HDFView software consists of the HDFView utility and the Java HDF
Object Package.

HDFView is a visual tool written in Java for browsing and editing HDF
(HDF5 and HDF4) files. Using HDFView, you can:

View a file hierarchy in a tree structure
Create new files, add or delete groups and datasets
View and modify the content of a dataset
Add, delete and modify attributes

HDFView uses the Java HDF Object Package, which implements HDF4 and
HDF5 data objects in an object-oriented form.
