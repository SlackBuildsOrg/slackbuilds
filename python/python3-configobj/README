python3-configobj (configuration file python module)

A python module for ultra simple handling of configuration files.
Also useful for human readable data persistence. Flexible and simple.

Upgrade note: the former libraries/configobj build has been removed,
and replaced with python2-configobj and python3-configobj. If you
still have configobj installed, you should remove it.
