VirtualXT is an IBM PC/XT (8088/V20) emulator that runs on modern
hardware and operating systems. It is designed to be simple and
lightweight yet still capable enough to run a large library of old
applications and games.

The virtualxt binary is built with an SDL2 frontend and meant to be run
by a non-root user. The user will need to be added to the "users"
group because the binary will open the provided boot images in read-
write mode and "users" has write access to those images.

For example:

usermod -aG users bob

The user's current working directory must be the same directory where
the virtualxt binary is installed. Because of this requirement, the
binary cannot be installed to a traditional location (e.g. /usr/bin/).

A wrapper script, virtualxt-wrapper.sh, has been provided so that the
user does not have to change to the directory where the virtualxt
binary is installed. This wrapper script may be found in
/usr/share/virtualxt/ and copied to a traditional location for
storing binaries.

For example:

cp /usr/share/virtualxt/virtualxt-wrapper.sh \
  /usr/bin/virtualxt-wrapper.sh
chmod +x /usr/bin/virtualxt-wrapper.sh

The wrapper script may then be executed as if the user's current
working directory is actually the directory where the virtualxt binary
is installed.

For example:

virtualxt-wrapper.sh -a boot/freedos.img
