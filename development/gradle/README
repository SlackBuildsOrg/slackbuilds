Gradle is build automation evolved.

Gradle can automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment and
more of software packages or other types of projects such as generated
static websites, generated documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to build.

Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle provides a
declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through sensible defaults.
Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of choice for many open source
projects, leading edge enterprises and legacy automation challenges.

## Documentation

To not include the docs to the build, you can use the following command:

  # INCLUDE_DOCS=NO ./gradle.Slackbuild

## Dependencies

Below is a link to the compatibility matrix for the java version to use
for a particular gradle version. I have tested this using zulu-openjdk17.
