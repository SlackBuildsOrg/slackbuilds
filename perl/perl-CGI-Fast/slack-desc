# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-CGI-Fast: perl-CGI-Fast (CGI Interface for Fast CGI)
perl-CGI-Fast:
perl-CGI-Fast: CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is
perl-CGI-Fast: specialized to work with the FCGI module, which greatly speeds up CGI
perl-CGI-Fast: scripts by turning them into persistently running server processes.
perl-CGI-Fast: Scripts that perform time-consuming initialization processes, such as
perl-CGI-Fast: loading large modules or opening persistent database connections,
perl-CGI-Fast: will see large performance improvements. Note that as CGI::Fast is
perl-CGI-Fast: based on CGI.pm it is no longer advised as a way to write Perl web
perl-CGI-Fast: apps.
