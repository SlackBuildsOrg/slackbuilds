Subtitle Editor is a GTK+2 tool to edit subtitles for GNU/Linux and
*BSD.

It can be used for new subtitles or as a tool to transform, edit,
correct and refine existing subtitle. This program also shows sound
waves, which makes it easier to synchronise subtitles to voices.

Subtitle Editor is free software released under the GNU General Public
License (GPL3).
