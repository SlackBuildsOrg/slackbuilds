waterfox (a fast and private web browser)

Waterfox is is built with privacy in mind. It does not track you,
and it doesn't make money from your data.
Waterfox has search partnerships. So it survives by making the
default search on Waterfox monetized. If you search with it,
Waterfox gets a share of the revenue.
You are under no obligation to use the default search - but if you
like what Waterfox does and want to support the project,
please consider using it.

This package installs to /opt/waterfox

In Slackware the annoying auto-update message can be disable using
a policies.json (installed at /opt/waterfox/distribution) by
passing "POLICIES=yes" to the build script like this:

    chmod +x waterfox.SlackBuild
    POLICIES=yes ./waterfox.SlackBuild

If uninstalling remember to manually remove $HOME/.waterfox
