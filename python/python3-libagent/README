This project allows you to use various hardware security devices to
operate GPG, SSH and age. Instead of keeping your key on your computer
and decrypting it with a passphrase when you want to use it, the key
is generated and stored on the device and never reaches your computer.

You can do things like sign your emails, git commits, and software
packages, manage your passwords (with pass and passage, among others),
authenticate web tunnels and file transfers, and more.
