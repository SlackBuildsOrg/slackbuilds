zuluCrypt (CLI and GUI frontend to cryptsetup).

zuluCrypt is a simple, feature rich and powerful solution for hard
drives encryption.

zuluCrypt is a front end to cryptsetup and tcplay and it allows easy
management of encrypted block devices.

zuluCrypt is made up of two components:
The back end, CLI interface is called "zuluCrypt-cli".
The front end is Qt GUI application called "zuluCrypt-gui.

* zuluCrypt:

zuluCrypt does hard drive encryption and it can manage plain dm-crypt
volumes, LUKS encrypted volumes, TrueCrypt encrypted volumes and
VeraCrypt encrypted volumes.

zuluCrypt can manage encrypted volumes that are hosted in image files,
in lvm volumes, in mdraid volumes as well as in hard drives and usb
sticks.

zuluCrypt can also encrypt stand alone files:
  zuluCrypt menu->zC->encrypt a file.

* zuluMount:

zuluMount is bundled with zuluCrypt and its meant to be used as a
general purpose tool that mount and unmount zuluCrypt supported
encrypted volumes as well as unencrypted volumes and it can be
used as a substitute to udisks,pmount and related tools.

zuluMount-gui can also be used as a frontend to encfs.

zuluMount-gui is ideal for use as a desktop environment/file manager
independent tool for mounting/unmounting encrypted and unencrypted
volumes.
