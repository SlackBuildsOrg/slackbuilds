cppy is a small C++ header library which makes it easier to write Python
extension modules. The primary feature is a PyObject smart pointer which
automatically handles reference counting and provides convenience
methods for performing common object operations.

cppy 1.2.0 is the last possible version for Slackware 15.0. Newer
versions require a newer python-setuptools.
