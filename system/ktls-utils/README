ktls-utils

In-kernel TLS consumers need a mechanism to perform TLS handshakes on
a connected socket to negotiate TLS session parameters that can then
be programmed into the kernel's TLS record protocol engine.

This package of software provides a TLS handshake user agent that
listens for kernel requests and then materializes a user space socket
endpoint on which to perform these handshakes. The resulting
negotiated session parameters are passed back to the kernel via
standard kTLS socket options.
