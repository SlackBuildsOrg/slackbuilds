# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-System-Sub: perl-System-Sub (Wrap external command with a DWIM sub)
perl-System-Sub:
perl-System-Sub: System::Sub provides in your package a sub that wraps the call to an
perl-System-Sub: external program. The return value is line(s) dependending on context
perl-System-Sub: (wantarray).
perl-System-Sub:
perl-System-Sub: This may be what you need if you want to run external commands as
perl-System-Sub: easily as from a Unix shell script but with a perl-ish feel
perl-System-Sub: (contextual output). So this is not a universal module for running
perl-System-Sub: external programs (like IPC::Run) but instead a simpler interface for
perl-System-Sub: a common style of external programs.
