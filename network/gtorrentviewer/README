gtorrentviewer (A torrent viewer and editor)

GTorrentViewer is a GTK2-based viewer and editor for BitTorrent meta
files. It is able to retrieve information from trackers, check files,
show detailed information, and modify .torrent files without having
to start downloading.

The purpose of GTorrentViewer is to give the ability to see and modify
all the possible information from .torrent files without having to start
downloading, and the ability to see in real time the current number of
seeds and peers on the torrent, so you will always know the status
before starting the download.
