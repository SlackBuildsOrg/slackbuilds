BTrees:  scalable persistent components

This package contains a set of persistent object containers built
around a modified BTree data structure.
The trees are optimized for use inside ZODB's "optimistic concurrency"
paradigm, and include explicit resolution of conflicts detected by
that mechanism.

Please see the Sphinx documentation at https://btrees.readthedocs.io/
for further information.
