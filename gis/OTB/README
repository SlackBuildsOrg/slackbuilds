ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is an open source library of image processing
algorithms.  OTB is based on the medical image processing library
ITK and offers particular functionalities for remote sensing image
processing in general and for high spatial resolution images in
particular. Targeted algorithms for high resolution optical images
(Pleiades, SPOT, QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral
sensors (Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are available.

Monteverdi, a satellite image viewer with access to OTB processing,
will also be built if MONTEVERDI=ON is passed to the script. This will
require the qwt package to be installed.

A QT application launcher will be built by default. Set QTGUI=OFF
to disable it (note that disabling Qt support will also disable
Monteverdi even if MONTEVERDI is set to ON).

OTB will be built with support for the following packages if they are
available at compile time: numpy3.
