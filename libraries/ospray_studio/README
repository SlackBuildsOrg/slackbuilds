Intel OSPRay Studio is an open source and interactive visualization and
ray tracing application that leverages Intel OSPRay as its core
rendering engine. It can be used to load complex scenes requiring high
fidelity rendering or very large scenes requiring supercomputing
resources.

The main control structure is a scene graph which allows users to
create an abstract scene in a directed acyclical graph manner. Scenes
can either be imported or created using scene graph nodes and structure
support. The scenes can then be rendered either with OSPRay's
pathtracer or scivis renderer.

In this build, support for Intel Open Image Denoise, OpenVDB,
OpenImageIO and OpenEXR is _not_ implemented.

Slackware-15.0 OpenEXR is, seemingly too low.

Patches are welcome.
