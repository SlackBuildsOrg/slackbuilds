Nuitka is **the** Python compiler. It is written in Python. It is a
seamless replacement or extension to the Python interpreter and
compiles **every** construct that Python 2 (2.6, 2.7) and Python 3
(3.4 - 3.13) have, when itself run with that Python version.

It then executes uncompiled code and compiled code together in an
extremely compatible manner.

You can use all Python library modules and all extension modules
freely.

Nuitka translates the Python modules into a C level program that
then uses libpython and static C files of its own to execute in
the same way as CPython does.

All optimization is aimed at avoiding overhead, where it's unnecessary.
None is aimed at removing compatibility, although slight improvements
will occasionally be done, where not every bug of standard Python is
emulated, e.g. more complete error messages are given, but there is a
full compatibility mode to disable even that.

Note: executables are called called "nuitka2" and "nuitka2-run"
this is per design to avoid conflict with the python3-nuitka package.
