# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description. Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in. You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct. It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fftw-mpi: fftw-mpi (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)
fftw-mpi:
fftw-mpi: FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the
fftw-mpi: Discrete Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions. It includes
fftw-mpi: complex, real, symmetric, and parallel transforms, and can handle
fftw-mpi: arbitrary array sizes efficiently. 
fftw-mpi: This package includes the support to MPI-2 implementation and is an
fftw-mpi: alternative to the fftw package released with the official Slackware.
