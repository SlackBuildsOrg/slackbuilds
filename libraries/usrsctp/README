SCTP user-land implementation (usrsctp)

SCTP is a message oriented, reliable transport protocol with direct
support for multihoming that runs on top of IP or UDP, and supports both
v4 and v6 versions.

Like TCP, SCTP provides reliable, connection oriented data delivery with
congestion control. Unlike TCP, SCTP also provides message boundary
preservation, ordered and unordered message delivery, multi-streaming
and multi-homing. Detection of data corruption, loss of data and
duplication of data is achieved by using checksums and sequence numbers.
A selective retransmission mechanism is applied to correct loss or
corruption of data.

usrsctp may be used by psi or psi-plus
