grabc (X11 pixel color grabber)

grabc is a simple but very useful program to determine the color
string in hex (or in RGB components) by clicking on a pixel on the
screen. While web browsing, lots of time you find a nice color and
wonder what color is that? Well, just use grabc!

Note: the previous version of grabc was 1.1, and the current version
is 1.0.2. This is *not* a downgrade or a mistake: the 1.1 release is
from 1998; 1.0.2 is from 2018, and has some bug fixes and includes
a man page. Apparently "1.1" was a typo for "1.0.1". Please don't
contact the maintainer asking to "upgrade" this to 1.1.
