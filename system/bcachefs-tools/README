reliability and robustness and the complete set of features one would 
expect from a modern filesystem.

-    Multiple devices
-    Replication
-    Erasure coding (not stable)
-    Caching, data placement
-    Compression
-    Encryption
-    Snapshots
-    Nocow mode
-    Reflink
-    Extended attributes, ACLs, quotas
-    Scalable - has been tested to 100+ TB, expected to scale far 
     higher (testers wanted!)
-    High performance, low tail latency
-    Already working and stable, with a small community of users
