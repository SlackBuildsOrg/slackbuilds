wmnotify (dock application)

DockApp e-mail notification program for POP3 and IMAP4 servers.

wmnotify is a DockApp application, running under WindowMaker, to
periodically check a POP3 or IMAP4 email account for new messages. It
also supports SSL encryption.

When new messages are detected, the mailbox image is animated to give a
visual indication that new mail has arrived. Additionnally, if desired,
a sound can be produced from a WAV or AU audio file, or from the console
bell. For simplicity reasons, wmnotify doesn't support multiple POP3
accounts.

But by starting a new instance of wmnotify and specifying an alternate
configuration file on the command line, you can effectively check
multiple POP3 accounts.

NOTE: There's a patch inside the package to replace the non-stop
animation to a static image for incomming e-mails. Just edit the
building script and set the "PATCH" variable to "yes" or pass a
parameter to the build script:

      PATCH=yes ./wmnotify.SlackBuild
