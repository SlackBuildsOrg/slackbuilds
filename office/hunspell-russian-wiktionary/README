hunspell-russian-wiktionary packages a Russian spellchecking
dictionary based on Russian Wiktionary, regularly updated by Kek.

The dictionary is one of the most complete dictionaries for the
Russian language, but it is inconsistent in its treatment
in "ye" versus "yo". For example "ее" is accepted, but "елка" is
not.

The build ships one dictionary, which can be passed to the
Hunspell's "-d" option.
