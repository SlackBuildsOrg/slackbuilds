Taskopen allows you to link almost any file, webpage or command
to a taskwarrior task by adding a filepath, web-link or uri as an
annotation. Text notes, images, PDF files, web addresses, spreadsheets
and many other types of links can then be filtered, listed and
opened by using taskopen. Some actions are sane defaults, others
can be custom-configured, and everything else will use your systems
mime-types to open the link.
