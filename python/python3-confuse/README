python3-confuse: painless YAML config files

Confuse is a configuration library for Python that uses YAML. It takes
care of defaults, overrides, type checking, command-line integration,
environment variable support, human-readable errors, and standard
OS-specific locations.

NOTE: 2.1.0 is the last version to support python-3.9
