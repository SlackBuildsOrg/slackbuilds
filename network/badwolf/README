badwolf is a minimalist browser that cares about privacy, it is based on
WebKitGTK and thus also accepts WebKitGTK (and dependencies) flags and
environment variables.

Runtime configuration specific to badwolf will probably get added at a
later release.

Features include:
* No browser-level tracking, multiple ephemeral isolated sessions per
  new unrelated tabs, JavaScript off by default.
* Small codebase (~1500 LoC), reuses existing components when available
  or makes it available.
* WebKitGTK native extensions, Interface customizable through CSS.
* Stable User-Interface; The common shortcuts are available (and
  documented), no vi-modal edition or single-key shortcuts are used.
* Dialogs are only used when required, javascript popups open in a
  background tab.
