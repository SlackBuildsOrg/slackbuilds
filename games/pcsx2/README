PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. Its
purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of MIPS
CPU Interpreters, Recompilers and a Virtual Machine which manages
hardware states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2
games on your PC, with many additional features and benefits.

PCSX2 requires a CPU that supports the SSE4.1 instruction set.
Check your processor flags with lscpu for sse4_1.

PCSX2 requires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3 or Vulkan 1.1.
