ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is an open source library of image processing
algorithms.
OTB is based on the medical image processing library ITK and offers
particular functionalities for remote sensing image processing in
general and for high spatial resolution images in particular. Targeted
algorithms for high resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT,
QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors
(Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are available.

This slackbuild is based on a legacy version of OTB and includes by
default the satellite image viewer Monteverdi, with access to OTB
processing, in a single build.

OTB-legacy will be built with support for the following packages if
they are available at compile time: numpy3, openmpi, glfw3.

Warning: the build fails if Shark is not built against the optional
dependency cblas that gives the support to ATLAS.
