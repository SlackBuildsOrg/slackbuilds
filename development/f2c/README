f2c is a Fortran-to-C converter.

This package includes libf2c, which must be linked to the resulting C
code.

The general idea is: f2c foo.f; gcc foo.c -lf2c -lm

Or use the fc script provided in the docs directory. Beware, fc is
also an (unrelated) bash builtin.

f2c once used two separate libraries, libi77 and libf77. These are
now rolled together into libf2c.  NB libf2c carries separate version
numbers from f2c itself. The version number associated with the
SlackBuilds package is the f2c version number.

If combining with gfortran, you may want to use gfortran -ff2c. See
the gfortran man page.

The official Netlib repository provides only the most recent version,
with no renaming of files on update. To avoid checksum errors
following each f2c update, the .info file points to a unofficial,
version-specific tarball maintained at a third-party site.

This SlackBuild builds only the shared library.
