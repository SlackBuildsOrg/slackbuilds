UWM, also known as UDE (The Unix Desktop Environment), is a minimal
window manager with very few dependencies and a rather unique GUI.
The name is somewhat of a misnomer though, it has no direct bearing
on Unix and shouldn't be confused with the Ultrix Window Manager. The
package does not include a manpage, but there is a PDF manual in
/usr/doc/uwm-* that new users will find helpful.
