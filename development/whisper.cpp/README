High-performance inference of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech
recognition (ASR) model:

    -Plain C/C++ implementation without dependencies
    -Apple Silicon first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON,
       Accelerate framework, Metal and Core ML
    -AVX intrinsics support for x86 architectures
    -VSX intrinsics support for POWER architectures
    -Mixed F16 / F32 precision
    -4-bit and 5-bit integer quantization support
    -Zero memory allocations at runtime
    -Support for CPU-only inference
    -Efficient GPU support for NVIDIA
    -Partial OpenCL GPU support via CLBlast
    -OpenVINO Support
    -C-style API

This package fails to build if both blas and OpenBLAS are installed.

Optional autodetected dependencies:
-OpenBLAS || blas
-openvino
