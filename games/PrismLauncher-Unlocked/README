PrismLauncher-Unlocked (An Open Source Minecraft launcher)

This project is a Fork of Prism Launcher,
which aims to 'unblock' the use of Offline Accounts,
disabling the restriction of having a functional Online
Account. No other modifications were applied to
the project's source code.

An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free
redistributability.

A Microsoft or Mojang account that owns Minecraft is required to
download and play the game through PrismLauncher.

zulu-openjdk17 can be used instead of OpenJDK17, if one wishes to do
so. Other versions of Java may be needed to run different versions of
Minecraft.

1.20.5 or newer: zulu-openjdk21
1.17 to 1.20.4:  OpenJDK17 or zulu-openjdk17
1.16 or older:   openjdk8 or zulu-openjdk8

If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your
system, make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointed
to OpenJDK17 when building PrismLauncher-Unlocked.
