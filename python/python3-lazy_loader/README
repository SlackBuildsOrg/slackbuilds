python3-lazy_loader (Load subpackages and functions on demand)

lazy_loader makes it easy to load subpackages and functions on demand.

Motivation:
1. Allow subpackages to be made visible to users without incurring
import costs.
2. Allow external libraries to be imported only when used, improving
import times.
