A Ruby module for accessing the ncurses library

This ncurses interface provides access to the functions, macros,
global variables and constants of the ncurses library. These are
mapped to a Ruby Module named "Ncurses": Functions and external
variables are implemented as singleton functions of the Ncurses
module.
