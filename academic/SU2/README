SU2 - Open-Source CFD code

Open-source suite for Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis and
PDE-constrained optimization problems. Designed with Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but
extensible to arbitrary sets of governing equations such as potential
flow, elasticity, electrodynamics, chemically-reacting flows, and many
others. Under active development by individuals all around the world
on GitHub and is released under an open-source license.

Optional dependencies: mpich or openmpi; OpenBLAS

Build options can be controlled by passing MESONOPTS to the SlackBuild
script.

Builds parallel version by default if mpich or openmpi installed. If
mpich, use:

MESONOPTS="-Dcustom-mpi=true -Dextra-deps=mpich"

For OpenBlas, add "-Denable-openblas=true"

See the docs for a complete list of options.

Following installation, add these to your ~/.bashrc:

export SU2_RUN=/usr/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$SU2_RUN
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$SU2_RUN
