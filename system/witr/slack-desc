# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

witr: witr (Port Tracing)
witr:
witr: witr exists to answer a single question: Why is this running?
witr: When something is running on a system whether it is a process,
witr: a service, or something bound to a port there is always a cause.
witr: That cause is often indirect, non-obvious, or spread across multiple
witr: layers such as supervisors, containers, services, or shells.
witr: Existing tools (ps,top,lsof,ss,docker ps) expose state and metadata.
witr: They show what is running, but leave the user to infer
witr: why by manually correlating outputs across tools.
