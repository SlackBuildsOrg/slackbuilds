# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Tie-IxHash: perl-Tie-IxHash (implements ordered in-memory associative arrays)
perl-Tie-IxHash:
perl-Tie-IxHash: If you have been led to believe that associative arrays in perl
perl-Tie-IxHash: don't preserve order, and if you have ever craved for that feature,
perl-Tie-IxHash: this module is for you.  Simply declare a "tie" for the hash variable
perl-Tie-IxHash: that you want to be order-preserving, and forget that limitation ever
perl-Tie-IxHash: existed.  You can do other nifty things with the tied hash object that
perl-Tie-IxHash: you may be used to doing with arrays, like Push(), Pop() and Splice().
