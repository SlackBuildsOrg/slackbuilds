Gede is a graphical frontend (GUI) to GDB written in C++ and using
the Qt4 (or Qt5) toolkit. Gede supports debugging programs written in
FreeBasic, C++, C and Rust. The goals of Gede are: to be fast
debugger, to use as few as possible external dependencies, to run
using a external GDB instance, and to avoid unnecessary features.
