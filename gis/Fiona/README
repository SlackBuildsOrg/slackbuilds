Fiona provides uncomplicated Python interfaces to functions in OGR,
the best open source C/C++ library for reading and writing geographic
vector data.

Fiona is designed to be simple and dependable. It focuses on reading
and writing data in standard Python IO style, and relies upon familiar
Python types and protocols such as files, dictionaries, mappings, and
iterators instead of classes specific to OGR. Fiona can read and write
real-world data using multi-layered GIS formats and zipped virtual
file systems and integrates readily with other Python GIS packages
such as pyproj, Rtree and Shapely.

Fiona 1.9.4.post1 is the last available version for Slackware 15.0.
Newer versions require a newer Cython (at >= 3.0.2).
