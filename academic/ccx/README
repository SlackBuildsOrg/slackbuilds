CalculiX CrunchiX (ccx) is a free software 3D finite element (FEM) solver
by Guido Dhondt of the MTU Aero Engines GmbH (Muenich, Germany).
The solver is able to do linear and non-linear calculations.
Static, dynamic and thermal solutions are available.
CalculiX upstream package include the default CalculiX GraphiX (cgx)
pre and post-processor.
Because the solver makes use of the ABAQUS input format it is also
possible to use commercial pre-processors as well.
CalculiX CrunchiX supports the multithreaded (MT) solve option of the
spooles sparse solver. This option is enabled at compile time. By default,
the single-threaded solver is used. This can be changed by setting the
OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable (e.g. export OMP_NUM_THREADS="$(nproc)"
at bash prompt).
