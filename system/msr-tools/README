MSR Tools project provides utilities to access the processor MSRs and
CPU ID directly.

This project is composed of three different user space console
applications.

    rdmsr – read MSR from any CPU or all CPUs
    wrmsr – write values to MSR on any CPU or all CPUs
    cpuid – show identification and feature information of any CPU
