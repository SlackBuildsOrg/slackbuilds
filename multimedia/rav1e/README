rav1e is the fastest and safest AV1 video encoder. It is designed to
eventually cover all use cases, though in its current form it is most
suitable for cases where aom (the reference encoder) is too slow.

Features:

* Intra, inter, and switch frames
* 64x64 superblocks
* 4x4 to 64x64 RDO-selected square and rectangular blocks
* DC, H, V, Paeth, smooth, and all directional prediction modes
* DCT, (FLIP-)ADST and identity transforms (up to 64x64, 16x16 and 32x32
  respectively)
* 8-, 10- and 12-bit depth color
* 4:2:0, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma sampling
* 11 speed settings (0-10, exhaustive to near real-time)
* Constant quantizer and target bitrate (single- and multi-pass)
  encoding modes
* Still picture mode

rust16 and cargo-c are needed only at build time.
