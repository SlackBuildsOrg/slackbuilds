Nice graphical "df", showing you to what degree the mounted
filesystems are used.

Copy "sample.wmfsmrc" to "~/.wmfsmrc" and edit it for custom
configuration.

There are 3 available themes: "cyan", "highcolor" (default) and
"lowcolor" Find and edit "--with-xpm=" in "wmfsm.SlackBuild" to change
the theme if wanted.
