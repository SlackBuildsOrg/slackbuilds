a simple gemini server

It supports:
 * mime types
 * directory listing
 * chunked file transfer
 * passes most gemini-diagnostics tests
 * user-defined charset/lang meta attributes

The script will create ssl certificate with CN=localhost
If you wish change domain of ssl certificate: use DOMAIN variable
before execution of SlackBuild script.

 DOMAIN=slackbuilds.org ./gem.SlackBuild

Is created 'gmi' directory as database in /var
Certificates are saved in /var/gmi/tls path.
Capsule content must be save in /var/gmi/capsule path.

Overview:

/var/gmi           [ root:root  | 755 ]
├── capsule        [ root:users | 775 ]
├── log            [ root:users | 664 ]
└── tls            [ root:root  | 755 ]
    ├── server.crt [ root:root  | 644 ]
    └── server.key [ root:users | 640 ]

* daemon: that SlackBuild package have script for /etc/rc.d

NOTE: Here is already existent gem binary (package manager for Ruby),
then create alias for gem (gemini server):

 alias gem="/usr/sbin/gem"
 alias gemd="(ba)sh /etc/rc.d/rc.gem" - /bin/sh already appoint for bash
on Slackware.

* run gem as regular user, preferably - security questions.
