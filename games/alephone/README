alephone (open-source continuation of Marathon 2 engine)

Aleph One is the open source continuation of Bungie's Marathon 2 game
engine. Available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, Aleph One supports
Marathon 2 and Marathon Infinity natively, and Marathon through a
conversion called M1A1. Many third party scenarios and net maps are
also available.

Aleph One is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL).

Aleph One is just a game engine. The game data from at least one of
the Marathon series is required to play. Install one or more of
marathon-data, marathon2-data, and/or marathon-infinite-data.

See the READMEs for the game data packages for more information.

Optional dependencies (autodetected):
- miniupnpc, for opening router ports
- libmatroska, for film export

Upgrade note: After upgrading alephone to 20250829, the game Marathon
Evil (marathon-evil-data on SBo) segfaulted when starting a new
game. If this happens to you, the workaround is to delete the game's
per-user data:

  $ rm -f ~/.alephone/Evil*
