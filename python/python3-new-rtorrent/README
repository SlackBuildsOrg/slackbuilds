python3-new-rtorrent (A simple rTorrent interface written in Python)

The xmlrpc interface to rTorrent is extremely unintuitive and has
very little documentation, this project aims to make interfacing
with rTorrent much easier.

NOTE: This is a required dependency for another program, but it is not
required to be functional. Rather than adding all the dependencies of
rtorrent itself, rtorrent will not be added to REQUIRES line. If you
need rtorrent support with this module, you will need to install
rtorrent itself.
