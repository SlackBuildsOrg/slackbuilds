hamlib4 (the ham radio control libraries)

Hamlib is a development effort to provide a consistent C language
interface for programmers wanting to incorporate radio controls in their
programs.  Network daemons for radio and rotator control, along with
language bindings for C++, Perl, Python, TCL, and Lua are included.

Optional language bindings

To build either or all of the Perl, Python, TCL or Lua bindings, pass
one of or in combination:

        PL_MOD=yes
        PY_MOD=yes
        TCL_MOD=yes
        LUA_MOD=yes

to the build script.

Optional Python3 binding (experimental)

For those wishing to experiment with Python3 and Hamlib, bindings may be
built (exclusive of the normal Python2 bindings) by passing:

           PY3_MOD=yes

to the build script.  This option overrides PY_MOD.

All four bindings (either of the Python versions) may be passed to the
script to enable all bindings at build time.
