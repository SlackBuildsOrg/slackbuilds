# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-typeguard: python3-typeguard (Run-time type checker for Python)
python3-typeguard:
python3-typeguard: This library provides run-time type checking for functions defined
python3-typeguard: with PEP 484 argument (and return) type annotations, and any arbitrary
python3-typeguard: objects. It can be used together with static type checkers as an
python3-typeguard: additional layer of type safety, to catch type violations that could
python3-typeguard: only be detected at run time.
