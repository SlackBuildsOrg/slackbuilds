SpaceCadetPinball (3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet)

Reverse engineered port of 3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet, a game
bundled with Windows.

This currently only supports "3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet"
(the original pinball table included with some earlier versions of
Windows) and "Space Cadet" (one of three pinball tables from the
"Full Tilt! Pinball" game -- the other tables, "Skullduggery" and
"Dragon's Keep" are not currently supported.)

NOTE: This port does not include the actual pinball game files. These
must either be downloaded separately and extracted and moved to
/usr/share/SpaceCadetPinball/ or have the zip files (PinballXP.zip
and/or FULLTILT.zip) available in the SlackBuild directory, which will
cause the script to incorporate them automatically.

To manually add it, do the following:

"3D Pinball for Windows - Space Cadet" (aka 3DPB), copy the contents
of the unzipped folder to /usr/share/SpaceCadetPinball.

"Space Cadet" copy CADET.DAT and the SOUND/ folder from the CADET/
folder to /usr/share/SpaceCadetPinball.
