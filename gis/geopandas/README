GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to
pandas objects. It currently implements GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame
types which are subclasses of pandas.Series and pandas.DataFrame
respectively. GeoPandas objects can act on shapely geometry objects
and perform geometric operations.

geopy is an optional dependency for geocoding support.
