hunspell-russian-lebedev packages three Russian spellchecking
dictionaries for Hunspell.

It could be built from the same sources as shipped in an other
SlackBuilds.Org build called "ispell-dict-russian-lebedev".

The build ships three dictionaries, which can be passed to the
Hunspell's "-d" option.

1. Only Yo
2. Only Ye
3. Permissive

This language cannot be considered the most up-to-date in 2025,
but it is the most widespread, and it is the only one
(I am aware of), which exists in all three popular orthographies.
