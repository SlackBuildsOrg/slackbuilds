fallout2-ce (Fallout 2 Community Edition)

Fallout 2 Community Edition is a fully working re-implementation of
Fallout 2, with the same original gameplay, engine bugfixes, and some
quality of life improvements, that works (mostly) hassle-free on
multiple platforms.

Popular Fallout 2 total conversion mods are partially
supported. Original versions of Nevada and Sonora (that do not rely
on extended features provided by Sfall) likely work, although there
is no complete walkthrough confirmation yet. Fallout 2 Restoration
Project, Fallout Et Tu and Olympus 2207 are not yet supported. Other
mods (particularly Resurrection and Yesterday) are not tested.
