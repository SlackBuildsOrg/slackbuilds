The goal of this project is to produce a useful tool for arranging
terminals. It is inspired by programs such as gnome-multi-term,
quadkonsole, etc. in that the main focus is arranging terminals in
grids (tabs is the most common default method, which Terminator also
supports).

Optionally requires python-keybinder
