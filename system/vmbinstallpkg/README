vmbinstallpkg and vmbremovepkg install and remove packages built from
the SlackBuilds.org repository. Using HooRex, a dialog screen showing
the target and all packages it depends on is presented for the user 
to approve for installation (or removal).

The target dependencies calculated by HooRex must be up to date. This
implies access to a local, up to date version of the SBo repository
with HooRex configured to use it (man hoorex).

Configurable settings are defined in /etc/default/vmbinstallpkg

After packages are approved for installation or removal, sudo is used
to enable the user to perform the necessary action.
