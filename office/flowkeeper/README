Flowkeeper is a new desktop software timer for Pomodoro Technique(R),
which is a very simple yet effective way to increase personal
productivity, currently licensed as freeware.

Daily task plan file (flowkeeper.xml) is stored by the program in user's
$HOME directory.

Even if the program has somewhat limited functionality (being in its
first version), you can easily edit this XML file (but only when the
program is not running!).

It is compatible with jdk (from SlackBuilds.org) and with OpenJDK.
