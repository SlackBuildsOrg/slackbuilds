PrismLauncher (An Open Source Minecraft launcher)

An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free
redistributability.

A Microsoft or Mojang account that owns Minecraft is required to
download and play the game through PrismLauncher.

To build PrismLauncher you can use any JDK version (8..25) and variant
(Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, Zulu OpenJDK). Keep in mind, however, that in
order to run different mods and Minecraft versions you may need
different Java versions.

1.20.5 or newer: Java SE 21
1.17 to 1.20.4:  Java SE 17
1.16 or older:   Java SE 8

Optional dependencies are:
- qt6:   use QT6=yes to build PrismLauncher with Qt6 instead of Qt5
- scdoc: if present at build time, a man page for PrismLauncher will be
         generated
- glfw3: use system GLFW libraries
- flite: narrator support
- orca:  screen reader support
