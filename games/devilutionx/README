DevilutionX is a source port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to
make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements,
bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the manual (https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki)
for what features are available and how best to take advantage of
them.

You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't
have an original CD then you can buy Diablo from GoG.com. Alternately
you can use spawn.mpq from the shareware version, in place of
DIABDAT.MPQ, to play the shareware portion of the game.

simpleini, smpq are optional dependencies that will be automatically
detected during compilation, if present.
