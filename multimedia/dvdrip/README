dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl.
It provides an easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost
all aspects of the ipping and transcoding process.  It uses the widely
known video processing swissknife transcode and many other Open Source
tools.

ffmpeg, lsdvd, ogmtools, mjpegtools, xvid4conf, subtitleripper, fping,
and rar are optional dependencies.
