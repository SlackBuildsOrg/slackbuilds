quivira-font (OpenType font)

Quivira is a Unicode-based OpenType font containing much more glyphs
than most of the well-known fonts. It is free to use. It provides a
large character repertoire, so that texts containing rather unusual
characters can be rendered pleasingly.

Quivira is a free Unicode font in the OpenType format which is
supported by every usual office program or printer. From a typographic
point of view, Quivira is a proportional serif font like e.g. the
more well-known Times New Roman and Garamond. Thus it is suitable for
writing well readable texts. Quivira 4.1 contains 11,053 characters.

Quivira is a variable-width font; it's not suitable for use with
terminals, though it can be used as a "fallback" font in urxvt's
URxvt*font resource. Example for use in ~/.Xdefaults:

URxvt*font: Deja Vu Sans Mono:size=14,xft:Quivira:size=14

This will allow urxvt to display glyphs that don't exist in the main
font (Deja Vu Sans Mono, above) using Quivira.
