# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ktls-utils: ktls-utils (TLS handshake utilities for in-kernel TLS consumers)
ktls-utils:
ktls-utils: In-kernel TLS consumers need a mechanism to perform TLS handshakes on
ktls-utils: a connected socket to negotiate TLS session parameters that can then
ktls-utils: be programmed into the kernel's TLS record protocol engine. This
ktls-utils: package of software provides a TLS handshake user agent that listens
ktls-utils: for kernel requests and then materializes a user space socket
ktls-utils: endpoint on which to perform these handshakes. The resulting
ktls-utils: negotiated session parameters are passed back to the kernel via
ktls-utils: standard kTLS socket options.
