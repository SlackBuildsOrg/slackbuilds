KeePassXC is a password and personal data management application that
supports the KeePass Password Safe file format.

KeePassXC is a fork of KeePassX that aims to incorporate stalled Pull
Requests, features, and bug fixes that are not being incorporated
into the main KeePassX baseline. KeePassXC may be installed alongside
KeePassX (also available as a SlackBuild).

KeePassXC can be built with YubiKey two-factor authentication
support for unlocking the database. This introduces a dependency on
misc/ykpers and can be enabled by passing YUBIKEY=ON to the script.

Browser support is enabled by default, meaning that KeePassXC
can function as password storage for Mozilla Firefox and
Chromium/Chrome. This may be disabled by passing BROWSER=OFF to the
script.

KeePassXC will be built with SSH agent support, allowing it to
interact with a running agent. This may be disabled by passing
SSHAGENT=OFF to the script.

Networking support, allowing website favicons to be downloaded, is
enabled by default. This maybe disabled by passing NETWORKING=OFF to
the script.

To include documentation, rubygem-asciidoctor must be installed and
DOCS=ON must be passed to the script.

Support for database sharing and synchronisation using KeeShare will
be disabled. It can be enabled by setting KEESHARE=ON, or a secure
version can be enabled with KEESHARE_SECURE=ON.

KeePassXC will display a notification of new releases unless the option
UPDATECHECK=OFF is provided.

Autotype may be disabled by passing AUTOTYPE=OFF.
