phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP intended to handle the
administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web. phpMyAdmin supports a
wide range of operations with MySQL. The most frequently used operations
are supported by the user interface (managing databases, tables, fields,
relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc), while you still have the
ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

By default, there is only a sample config file included with the
package.  You can either copy that file and edit it according to your
taste or you can do a graphical setup.  Both processes are detailed in
the docs.

You can override DOCROOT, PHPUSER, and PHPGROUP at build time.
They default to DOCROOT=/var/www/htdocs, PHPUSER=root, PHPGROUP=apache.
