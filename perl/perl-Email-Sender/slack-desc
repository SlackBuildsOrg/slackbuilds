# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Email-Sender: Email::Sender replaces the old and sometimes problematic Email::Send
perl-Email-Sender: library, which did a decent job at handling very simple email sending
perl-Email-Sender: tasks, but was not suitable for serious use, for a variety of reasons.
