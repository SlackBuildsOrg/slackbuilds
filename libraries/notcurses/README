notcurses (Blingful character graphics/TUI library)

notcurses is a library facilitating complex TUIs on modern terminal
emulators, supporting vivid colors, multimedia, threads, and Unicode to
the maximum degree possible. Things can be done with Notcurses that
simply can't be done with NCURSES. It is furthermore fast. It is not a
source-compatible X/Open Curses implementation, nor a replacement for
NCURSES on existing systems.

By default, this SlackBuild disables documentation generating via
pandoc and QR code generation. To enable those features, you must set
the respective environment variable when running the script, and have
the necessary dependencies installed, which are listed below.

Options:
  USE_PANDOC    - For documentation generation
  USE_QRCODEGEN - For QR code generation

To enable all optional features, you could run the SlackBuild script
like this:
  USE_PANDOC=yes USE_QRCODEGEN=yes bash notcurses.SlackBuild

Optional dependencies:
  pandoc/pandoc-bin - For USE_PANDOC
  QR-Code-generator - For USE_QRCODEGEN
