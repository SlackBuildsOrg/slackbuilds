Warning breaking change - Release 2.0 contains a breaking change;
see the release notes at:
https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python/releases/tag/v2.0.0
and migration details at:
https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/migrations.html

This document describes the source code for the Eclipse Paho MQTT
Python client library, which implements versions 5.0, 3.1.1, and 3.1
of the MQTT protocol.

This code provides a client class which enable applications to
connect to an MQTT broker to publish messages, and to subscribe to
topics and receive published messages. It also provides some helper
functions to make publishing one off messages to an MQTT server very
straightforward.

Python 2 is no longer supported. Minimum required is Python 3.7+.

The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of
Things" connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight
publish/subscribe messaging transport, it is useful for connections
with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or
network bandwidth is at a premium.

Paho is an Eclipse Foundation project.
