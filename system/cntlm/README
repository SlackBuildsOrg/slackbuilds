Cntlm is an NTLM / NTLM Session Response / NTLMv2 authenticating HTTP
proxy intended to help you break free from the chains of Microsoft
proprietary world. You can use a free OS and honor our noble idea,
but you can't hide. Once you're behind those cold steel bars of a
corporate proxy server requiring NTLM authentication, you're done
with. The same even applies to 3rd party Windows applications, which
don't support NTLM natively.

This package contain a start/stop script: /etc/rc.d/rc.cntlm

If you need start cntlm at boot add the following to your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local script and make sure rc.cntlm has executable
permissions set:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.cntlm ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.cntlm start
  fi
