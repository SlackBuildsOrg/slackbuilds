Qt6 configuration utility.

This program allows users to configure Qt6 settings (theme, font, icons,
etc.) under DE/WM without Qt integration.

For it to work, QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct must be set in the
environment (or qt5ct for compatibility with qt5ct).

Under Wayland, it is also necessary to set QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
