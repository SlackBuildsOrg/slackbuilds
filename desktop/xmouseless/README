This program is a replacement for the physical mouse in Linux.

This use your keyboard as mouse.

Features:
 * move the mouse with different speeds
 * click and grab
 * scroll
 * execute shell commands

If you wish different keybindings for mouse control with keyboard:
 Extract 'config.h' of source:

  tar xfO xmouseless-(commit).tar.gz --wildcards '*/config.h' > config.h

 This file have configurations of speed, clicks, scroll, etc.
 - Change values from that for what you need :)

SlackBuild script will substitute 'config.h' for the modified.

NOTE: this program is not perfect. Showed errors with GTK applications
and some window managers. Anyway, the program is limited.

It has a sucessor (mouseless) build in Go language, but is not so simple
like xmouseless.
