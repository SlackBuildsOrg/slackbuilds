kc is a console based password storing application using an encrypted
XML document as its database.

Features include (but not limited to):
 * fixed string or regex based search (if compiled with pcre)
 * encrypted or plain text database import/export
 * fuzzy displaying of passwords if you suspect someone might watch
   your monitor
 * copy passwords to various clipboards
 * multiple keychains per database
 * the usual editing functions
 * compiles and works on *BSD and Linux
 * editline (libedit) and readline support
 * clean and simple CLI with command and keychain completion

This SlackBuild has build options to control some of its behavior:
LIBSCRYPT: If this variable is set, kc will be built with scrypt
      encrypted passwords support. It needs the libscrypt library
      for this, that is also available from SBo.
EDITLINE: If this variable is set, kc will use editline for its
      command line interface; otherwise, readline will be used.
