Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course
of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They
then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill
the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Each turn is
time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with
excessive thinking or moving.

This SlackBuild packages only the game itself. If you want to compile
the server, you will need to provide additional dependencies.
Please, refer to the documentation in the source tarball.

Note for 32-bit users: on x86, ignore the fpc in the .info file's
REQUIRES. For 32-bit builds, hedgewars requires ghc, not fpc. Yes,
this is weird, but it's true.
