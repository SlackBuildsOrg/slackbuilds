Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X
for Linux and Unix.

wine-staging is the current development branch of wine appended with
full patches of the staging branch.

It contains bug fixes and features, which have not been integrated into
the development branch yet. The idea of wine-staging is to provide
experimental features faster to end users and to give developers the
possibility to discuss and improve their patches before they are
integrated into the main branch.

NOTE: This builds the cutting-edge version of wine. If you need
something more stable then you may want to check out wine.

NOTES

64bit systems now default to the new WOW64 mode which builds both 64bit
and 32bit PE dlls. This has removed the multilib dependency that was
pereviously required and will allow execution of both 64bit and 32bit
binaries. No multilib required.
