Exporter::Lite is an alternative to Exporter, intended to provide a
lightweight subset of the most commonly-used functionality. It supports
import(), @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK and not a whole lot else.

Exporter::Lite simply exports its import() function into your namespace.
This might be called a "mix-in" or a "role".

If you have local Perl set up and override the "install base" parameter
through the $PERL_MB_OPT or $PERL_MM_OPT variables then the build will
fail.
