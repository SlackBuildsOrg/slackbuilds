python3-pipdeptree (Show dependency trees of python packages)

pipdeptree is a command line utility for displaying the installed
python packages in form of a dependency tree. It works for packages
installed globally on a machine as well as in a virtualenv. Since pip
freeze shows all dependencies as a flat list, finding out which are
the top level packages and which packages do they depend on requires
some effort.

It's also tedious to resolve conflicting dependencies that could have
been installed because older version of pip didn't have true dependency
resolution. pipdeptree can help here by identifying conflicting
dependencies installed in the environment.
