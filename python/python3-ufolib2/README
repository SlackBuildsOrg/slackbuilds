ufolib2 is meant to be a thin representation of the
Union Font Object(UFO) version 3 data model intended for the
programmatic manipulation and fast batch processing og UFOs.
It resembles the defcon library but does so without the
notification,the layout engine and other support classes. Where
useful and possible it tries to be API compatible with defcon.
