cryptography is a Python library for 3.2+ which exposes cryptographic
recipes and primitives.

It's available under either the Apache Software License, Version 2.0,
or the BSD license.

NOTE: Cryptography 46.x is the last version working on Slackware 15.0.
Newer version requires newer cffi and they will drop support for
OpenSSL < 3.0 from future releases.
