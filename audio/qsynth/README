Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++
around the Qt4 toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve
into a softsynth management application allowing the user to control
and manage a variety of command line softsynths but for the moment
it wraps the excellent FluidSynth (http://www.fluidsynth.org)

Be aware: since Slackware-15.0, fluidsynth is part of slackware but
compiled WITHOUT jack support. If you need jack support for fluidsy-
nth you must recompiled with jack support.
