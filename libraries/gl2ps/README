GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any
OpenGL application.

The main difference between GL2PS and other similar libraries is
the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting and
stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects.

GL2PS provides advanced smooth shading and text rendering, culling of
invisible primitives, mixed vector/bitmap output, and much more...
