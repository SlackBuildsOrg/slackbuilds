FreeSWITCH is a scalable open source cross-platform telephony platform
designed to route and interconnect popular communication protocols
using audio, video, text or any other form of media.  It was
created in 2006 to fill the void left by proprietary commercial
solutions. FreeSWITCH also provides a stable telephony platform on
which many telephony applications can be developed using a wide range
of free tools.

Unlike other SlackBuilds which have a /usr installation prefix, this
script will install FreeSWITCH to /opt/freeswitch instatead. This
is done to simplify the build process since FreeSWITCH attemps to
install itself into many non-standard directories in the prefix
directory. Therefore, it is installed as a self-contained and
easily-removable location in /opt.

This script also expects there to be a user and group
called "freeswitch", with uid and gid of 269 (see
http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt):
# groupadd -g 269 freeswitch
# useradd -u 269 -d /opt/freeswitch \
    -s /bin/bash -g freeswitch freeswitch

If you execute the script without creating this user and group, it won't
build the FreeSWITCH package.

To enable building with PostgreSQL support, use:
# PGSQL=yes ./freeswitch.SlackBuild

To disable building with Python support, use:
# PYTHON=no ./freeswitch.SlackBuild

erlang-otp is another optional dependency (but this is autodetected).
