nbsdgames is a collection of simple ncurses games. It includes many
classic games that are missing from the traditional bsdgames
collection, such as: jewels, sudoku, mines, reversi, checkers, 
battleship, sos, rabbithole, pipes, fifteen, memoblocks, fisher,
muncher, miketron, redsquare, darrt, snakeduel and tugow. There is
a launcher program called nbsdgames. (in case you don't remember the
name of the game you'd like to play)

The games are installed in /usr/games, same as bsdgames.
