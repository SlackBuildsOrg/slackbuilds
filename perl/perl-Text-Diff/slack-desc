# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Text-Diff: perl-Text-Diff (Perform diffs on files and record sets)
perl-Text-Diff:
perl-Text-Diff: diff() provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff utility.
perl-Text-Diff: It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is
perl-Text-Diff: better integrated with Perl and available on all platforms.
perl-Text-Diff: It is often faster than shelling out to a system's diff executable for
perl-Text-Diff: small files, and generally slower on larger files.
