LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major
office suites, and available on a variety of platforms. It is free
software and therefore free to download, use and distribute.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's)
distributed by The Document Foundation.  Everything needed by the
application should be built statically into it, so there aren't any
dependencies not satisfied by a normal installation.

Be sure to look at the script for some optional things you can do when
building.

NOTE:
See the separate SlackBuild script for the language packs.
Avahi is only needed if you need to use Impress and Draw

WARNING:
LibreOffice 25.8.4 is the latest version working in Slackware 15.0 using
normal Slackware stock packages. Newer version requires newer glibc.

You can use this script to build for newer version, but for 15.0 users,
you will need to upgrade packages from testing/packages/binutils-gcc-glibc.

Place the new version source (eg. 26.2.0) in the same directory and run:
VERSION=26.2.0 sh libreoffice.SlackBuild

If you feel uncomfortable, please stick with the current 25.8.4 version
