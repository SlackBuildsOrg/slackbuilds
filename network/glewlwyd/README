Glewlwyd Oauth 2 authentication server

Oauth 2 Server providing JSON Web Tokens for identification.

Lightweight, fast and easy to install on small systems.
Requires a MySql, PostgreSQL or SQLite3 database.
Handles LDAP or database for users backend.

The API backend is fully written in language C, it's based on Ulfius
HTTP framework, Hoel database framework and Libjwt JSON Web Tokens
library.

Set GLEWLWYD_SQLITE_INIT=1 to initialize, if it doesn't exists already, a
proper SQLite /var/cache/glewlwyd/glewlwyd.db when installing the package.
The sample configuration file in /etc/glewlwyd/glewlwyd.conf.sample is
then directly usable with the pretty insecure admin/password credentials.
