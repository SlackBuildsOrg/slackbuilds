zabbix_agent2 is the new generation Linux agent written on golang.
Used to monitor Linux boxes and send the data to the zabbix server.

Zabbix offers advanced monitoring, alerting and visualization
features, including distributed monitoring, auto-discovery,
notifications, etcetera.

zabbix_agent2 needs to run under its own user/group. This has been
assigned to the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change
it on your system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbixagent       UID: 266        GID: 266
  group:  zabbixagent                       GID: 266

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXAGENTUSER and ZABBIXAGENTGROUP variables when running the build
script.

For some important post-build and basic configuration instructions,
see the included README.SLACKWARE file.
