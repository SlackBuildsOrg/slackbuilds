AMIDE is a competely free tool for viewing, analyzing, and registering
volumetric medical imaging data sets. It's been written on top of GTK+,
and runs on any system that supports this toolkit (Linux, Windows,
Mac OS X, etc.).

FEATURES:
* Abitrary orientation, thickness, and time period slice viewing of
  a data set.
* Thick slabs can be generated by averaging (MPR), taking the
  maximum (MIP), or the minimum (MIP).
* Multiple data sets can be loaded and viewed at once.
* Nearest Neighbor and Trilinear interpolation functions
* Zooming
* Black/White,White/Black,Red/Green/Blue Temperature,
  Hot Metal/Blue/Green, Spectrum, NIH/UCLA colormaps
* Thresholding: data sets are thresholded independently.
* 3-dimensional ROI's can be drawn directly on the images and
  statistics can be generated for these ROI's.
* Imports raw data files (8bit,16bit,32bit,float,etc).
* Imports Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), DICOM 3.0, InterFile3.3,
  ECAT 6/7, and Gif87a/89a (using the (X)medcon/libmdc).
* Imports most clinical DICOM files (using the DCMTK library).
* Allows cropping and clearing regions of data sets.
* Anisotropic filtering wizard.
* Saves studies (ROI and Data Set data) as XML data.
* Series of slices can be viewed.
* Fly through movies can be generated as MPEG1 files
* True volume rendering support with the capability of rendering
  multiple data sets at a time. Series of renderings can be saved
  as MPEG1 movies. Data sets can also be rendered as stereoscopic
  image pairs
* Alignment of data sets is supported using fiducial markers.
* A profile tool is included that can calculate gaussian fits and
  FWHM's of the generated line profiles.
