Low level terminal interface library for modern terminals.
It’s designed to be portable and flexible to integrate.It covers
event handling and rendering.Termpaint is meant as a basic building
block to build more specific libraries upon.There are a lot of
different higher layer styles, so it’s cleaner to have separate
libraries for this.

docopt,fmt,catch2,picojson are optional dependencies.
