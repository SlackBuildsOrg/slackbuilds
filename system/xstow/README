XStow is a replacement for GNU Stow written in C++. It supports all
features of GNU Stow with some extensions. Even the command line
options are compatible.

XStow and GNU Stow are programs for managing the installation of
software packages, keeping them separate (/usr/local/stow/emacs vs.
/usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while making them appear to be
installed in the same place (/usr/local).

XStow installs packages in the exact same way as GNU Stow.
