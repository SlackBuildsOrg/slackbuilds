yank (yank terminal output to clipboard)

The yank(1) utility reads input from stdin and display a selection
interface that allows a field to be selected and copied to the
clipboard. Fields are either recognized by a regular expression using
the -g option or by splitting the input on a delimiter sequence using
the -d option.

Using the arrow keys will move the selected field. The interface
supports several Emacs and Vi like key bindings, consult the man page
for further reference. Pressing the return key will invoke the yank
command and write the selected field to its stdin. The yank command
defaults to xsel(1) but could be anything that accepts input on stdin.

Note: xsel is not a required dependency for this, but it's highly
recommended, at least if you're using X. For Wayland users, there's
probably an equivalent tool.
