ne is a free (GPL'd) text editor based on the POSIX standard that
runs on almost any UN*X machine. ne is easy to use for the beginner,
but powerful and fully configurable for the wizard, and most sparing
in its resource usage. If you have the resources and the patience to
use emacs or the right mental twist to use vi then probably ne is
not for you.
