MoleQueue is an open-source, cross-platform, system-tray resident
desktop application for abstracting, managing, and coordinating the
execution of tasks both locally and on remote computational resources.

Users can set up local and remote queues that describe where the task
will be executed. Each queue can have programs, with templates to
facilitate the execution of the program. Input files can be staged,
and output files collected using a standard interface.

It is a subproject of OpenChemistry needed by Avogadro 2.
