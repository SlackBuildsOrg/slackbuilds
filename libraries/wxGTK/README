wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native
platform's controls and utilities.

This is a unicode shared build.
If you do not want the unicode build, use:
  UNICODE=NO ./wxGTK.SlackBuild

If you want support for gnomeprint pass GNOMEPRINT=yes to the
script. This will require libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui, both
available from SlackBuilds.org.

This package conflicts with wxPython because wxGTK is already included
there. Both cannot be installed at the same time!
