canto-next (ncurses RSS aggregator)

canto is an Atom/RSS feed reader for the console that is meant to
be quick, concise, and colorful. It is meant to allow you to crank
through feeds like you've never cranked before, by providing a minimal
yet information-packed interface.

The package includes canto-daemon (which downloads the feeds in the
background), canto-curses (the reader), and canto-remote (which can be
used to control the daemon). Each of these has a man page. The default
location for canto's config and data is ~/.config/canto/ unless you
have changed XDG_CONFIG_HOME in the environment.

When you run canto-curses, it will automatically start canto-daemon
if it's not already running. If you want the daemon to exit when you
log out, add a line like this to your .bash_logout (or whatever logout
script your shell uses):

  canto-remote kill &>/dev/null

The "help" key for canto-curses is '?'. Remember that, if you can
remember nothing else.

Note for multilib users: You'll have to install python3-setuptools-opt
and its dependencies, to build canto-next. Pure 32-bit or 64-bit
doesn't require this, so I didn't put it in REQUIRES.

There are a few Slackware-specific RSS feeds that you might want to
add to canto-next's config. To do this, use either "canto-remote add
<URL>" or from within canto-curses, ":add <URL>".
