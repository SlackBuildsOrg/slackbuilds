slack-osquery - osquery extensions for Slackware

This extension provides extra tables for osquery on slackware.

After installation, you will need to configure osquery to load your
extension:

The extension currently exposes the package database through a table
called slackware_packages.

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not at runtime.
