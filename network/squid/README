Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process.

Squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request
logging. By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, squid
caches can be arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth
savings.

See /usr/doc/squid-*/README.SBo for configuration help.
Note that the default squid.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/squid files have
changed in this release, so be sure to merge the changes into place.

To build squid with ICAP client support, specify the option "ICAP=yes",
for example:

  ICAP=yes ./squid.SlackBuild
