# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-llvmlite: python3-llvmlite (Lightweight LLVM python binding)
python3-llvmlite:
python3-llvmlite: llvmlite is a project originally tailored for Numba's needs, using
python3-llvmlite: the following approach:
python3-llvmlite:
python3-llvmlite: A small C wrapper around the parts of the LLVM C++ API we need that
python3-llvmlite: are not already exposed by the LLVM C API.  A ctypes Python wrapper
python3-llvmlite: around the C API.  A pure Python implementation of the subset of
python3-llvmlite: the LLVM IR builder that we need for Numba.
