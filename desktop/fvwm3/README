Fvwm3 is the newest version of the fvwm window manager, the successor to
fvwm-2.6.x.

Fvwm3 is a multiple large virtual desktop window manager, originally
derived from twm in 1993.

Fvwm3 is intended to have a small memory footprint but a rich feature
set, be extremely customizable and extensible, and have a high degree of
Motif mwm compatibility.

Although an existing fvwm2 configuration should mostly work with fvwm3,
it isn't guaranteed to work without some modifications. This is because
longstanding deprecated options have been removed, for example.

This package does not conflict with the stock fvwm package.

Manpages for fvwm3 modules were moved as follows:
FvwmAnimate --> Fvwm3Animate
FvwmAuto --> Fvwm3Auto
...

google-go-lang is needed only at build time.
