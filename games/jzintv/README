jzintv (Intellivision emulator)

jzintv is an emulator and development environment for the Mattel
Intellivision game console. The doc directory includes development
documentation and sample Intellivision code, for those who want to
write their own Intellivision games.

The Intellivision console contains code in the form of ROM. jzintv
requires images of these ROMs in order to run. The package includes
the ROM images, so there's no need to search the 'net for them.

The package also includes 4-tris, an Intellivision game written by
the jzintv author and released under the GPL. To play 4-tris, use
a command like:

  $ jzintv /usr/share/games/jzintv/rom/4-tris/4-tris.rom

Slackware notes:

- Documentation

There is no man page for jzintv, but you can run "jzintv --help" to
see the options it supports. Since it's a command-line program, there
is no .desktop file included.

- Window Size

Without patching, the default window size (or screen size for
fullscreen with -f1) is 320x200. Since this is usually smaller
than a pack of playing cards on a modern (1080i or 4k) display, the
SlackBuild patches the code to use a larger default window size.

The default resolution used by the emulator can be controlled via
the DEFRES environment variable. This only sets the default, in the
absence of a -z option. DEFRES can be set to anything that the -z
option will accept: built-in modes 0 through 7, or WxH. The default is
"1360x1024", which should be fine on 1080i displays. If you have a 4K
display, you probably want something larger. Examples:

  # DEFRES=1024x768 sh jzintv.SlackBuild

  # DEFRES=2720x2048 sh jzintv.SlackBuild

The window size should be roughly a 4:3 aspect ratio (since that's
what the Intellivision displays), and the actual window size may be
slightly smaller than you set DEFRES to.
