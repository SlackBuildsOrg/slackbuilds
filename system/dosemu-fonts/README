dosemu-fonts (fonts from dosemu, packaged for system-wide use)

DOSEmu includes various VGA-style fonts, which get installed to a
private directory, used only by DOSEmu. This package installs the same
fonts in the system-wide /usr/share/fonts/misc directory, so other
software can use them.

These fonts are for codepages 437, 866, and 1125. ASCII text displays
correctly with them, but they don't support Unicode or ISO-8859-*
encodings. They're useful for applications such as BitchX (which uses
codepage 437) and viewing old text files from MS-DOS.

After the package is installed, you may have to run "xset fp rehash"
to make the fonts available to X. You can get a list of the fonts
with "xlsfonts -fn -dosemu-*". Also, there are short aliases, so you
can run e.g. "xterm -fn vga11x19". These are: vga vga8x19 vga11x19
vga10x24 vga12x30 vgacyr vga10x20 vga-ua vga10x20-ua.
