safecopy (data recovery tool)

safecopy is a data recovery tool which tries to extract as much data as
possible from problematic (i.e. damaged sectors) sources - like floppy
drives, hard disk partitions, CDs, tape devices.

safecopy claims to be useful in situations where other tools like dd
would fail due to I/O errors.

safecopy is released under GNU GPL v2 (or higher).
