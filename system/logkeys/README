logkeys is a linux keylogger. It is no more advanced than other
available linux keyloggers, notably lkl and uberkey, but is a bit
newer, more up to date, it doesn't unreliably repeat keys and it
shouldn't crash your X. All in all, it just seems to work. It relies
on event interface of the Linux input subsystem. Once completely set,
it logs all common character and function keys, while also being fully
aware of Shift and AltGr key modifiers.
