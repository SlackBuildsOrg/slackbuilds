Qtile is simple, small, and extensible. It's easy to write your own
layouts, widgets, and built-in commands. Qtile is written and configured
entirely in Python, which means you can leverage the full power and
flexibility of the language to make it fit your needs.

You will need to build python3-cairocffi with its optional
python3-xcffib dependency.

python3-dbus-next is an optional dependency for qtile.
It sends notifications through dbus - please additionally install a
notification daemon such as dunst for displaying notifications on qtile.

python3-pywlroots (another optional dependency) provides experimental
Wayland support. If python3-pywlroots is installed, then this SlackBuild
will also install a Wayland .desktop session file.
