# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

protozero: protozero (Minimalistic protocol buffer decoder and encoder in C++.)
protozero: Designed for high performance. Suitable for writing zero copy parsers
protozero: and encoders with minimal need for run-time allocation of memory.
protozero: Low-level: this is designed to be a building block for writing a very
protozero: customized decoder for a stable protobuf schema. If your protobuf
protozero: schema is changing frequently or lazy decoding is not critical for
protozero: your application then this approach offers no value: just use the C++
protozero: API that can be generated with the Google Protobufs protoc program.
