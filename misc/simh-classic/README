SimH (History Simulator) is a collection of simulators for historically
significant or just plain interesting computer hardware and software
from the past. The goal of the project is to create highly portable
system simulators and to publish them as freeware on the Internet,
with freely available copies of significant or representative software.

SimH implements simulators for:

- Data General Nova, Eclipse
- Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1, PDP-4, PDP-7, PDP-8, PDP-9,
  PDP-10, PDP-11, PDP-15 (and UC15), VAX11/780, VAX3900
- GRI Corporation GRI-909, GRI-99
- IBM 1401, 1620, 7090/7094, System 3
- Interdata (Perkin-Elmer) 16b and 32b systems
- Hewlett-Packard 2114, 2115, 2116, 2100, 21MX, 1000, 3000
- Honeywell H316/H516
- MITS Altair 8800, 8080 only
- Royal-Mcbee LGP-30, LGP-21
- Scientific Data Systems SDS 940
- Xerox Data Systems Sigma 32b systems

This package contains the "classic" version of SimH, the 3.X stream.
This version is simpler than the 4.X stream, which can be found in
Github.

Note: Please add /opt/simh-classic/bin to your $PATH or simply
      invoke each simulator with simh-classic-"name".
      Example: simh-classic-vax
