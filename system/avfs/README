AVFS is a system, which enables all programs to look inside archived
or compressed files, or access remote files without recompiling the
programs or changing the kernel. At the moment it supports floppies,
tar and gzip files, zip, bzip2, ar and rar files, ftp sessions, http,
webdav, rsh/rcp, ssh/scp. Quite a few other handlers are implemented
with the Midnight Commander's external FS.
