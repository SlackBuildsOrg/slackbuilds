Waypipe

waypipe is a proxy for Wayland[0] clients. It forwards Wayland
messages and serializes changes to shared memory buffers over a single
socket. This makes application forwarding similar to ssh -X [1]
feasible.

aypipe should be installed on both the local and remote computers.
There is a user-friendly command line pattern which prefixes a call to
ssh and automatically sets up a reverse tunnel for protocol data. For
example,

waypipe ssh user@theserver weston-terminal


will run ssh, connect to theserver, and remotely run weston-terminal,
using local and remote waypipe processes to synchronize the shared
memory buffers used by Wayland clients between both computers. Command
line arguments before ssh apply only to waypipe; those after ssh
belong to ssh.
