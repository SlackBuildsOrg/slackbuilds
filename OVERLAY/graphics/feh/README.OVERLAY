This directory is a local OVERLAY of graphics/feh.

It tracks a newer upstream release (3.11.2) than the version currently
available in SlackBuilds.org (3.10.3).

On Slackware-current, the build requires defining _GNU_SOURCE, so the
SlackBuild adds -D_GNU_SOURCE to CFLAGS.

Changes in this directory are local-only and not intended for
upstream submission.
