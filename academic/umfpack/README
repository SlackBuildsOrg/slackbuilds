UMFPACK is a set of routines for solving unsymmetric sparse linear
systems, Ax=b, using the Unsymmetric MultiFrontal method.

This package is part of SuiteSparse.

This requires a BLAS implementation. Choose one of these package
sets:

 * OpenBLAS
 * atlas
 * blas (the Netlib reference implementation)

If more than one set is installed (assuming there are no packaging
conflicts) then the auto-detection will use the first implementation
from this list that it finds. If in doubt, choose the Netlib reference
implementations; other packages that require a BLAS or LAPACK
implementation may not build if they are not configured to detect/use
alternate implementations.
