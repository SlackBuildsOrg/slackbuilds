augustus-game (open source enhanced re-implementation of Caesar III)

Julius is a fully working open-source version of Caesar 3, with the
same logic as the original, but with some UI enhancements, that can be
played on multiple platforms.

Augustus is a fork of the Julius project that intends to incorporate
gameplay changes.

The aim of this project is to provide enhanced, customizable gameplay
to Caesar 3 using project Julius UI enhancements.

Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 and Julius saves, however saves made
with Augustus will not work outside Augustus.
