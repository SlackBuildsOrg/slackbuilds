CUDA Toolkit CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture. It
enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the
power of the GPU.

NOTE:
- the binary file to download is 4 Gb;
- the temporary package file will need 7 Gb;
- the final package will be around 4 Gb (7 Gb when installed).
Be sure to have enough free space before building this.

This is version 12, which should be installable together with
the default version 10.
You can activate it by sourcing /etc/profile.d/cuda-12.6.sh

NOTE:
This build is beta. CUDA is large and complicated,
suggestions welcome. If unsure, I suggest using the default
CUDA 10.
However, mpv and ffmpeg compile fine with this CUDA, and hardware
accelerated video decoding works.
