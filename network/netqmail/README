netqmail - djb's qmail mta.

This package is intended for folk who are using qmail now and might
like a clean way to install and remove the latest version there is.

daemontools is an optional dependency, highly recommended.

The following 2 changes are made to the installed layout:

1. man pages formerly under /var/qmail/man are moved to /usr/man, and
2. documentation formerly under /var/qmail/doc is moved to the usual
   Slackware documentation location.

Please see README.SBo for important information on how to build and
install this package.

You can perform test installs to a chroot environment - see
tests/README.
