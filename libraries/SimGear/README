SimGear is a set of open-source libraries designed to be used as
building blocks for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and
visualization applications.

Note that the source has been moved from Sourceforge to Gitlab.

BIG FAT NOTE: SimGear and FlightGear will no longer build on current
because of incompatibilities in boost 1.87 (built fine with 1.86).
