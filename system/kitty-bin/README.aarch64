Although SBo doesn't officially support ARM, and I personally don't
use ARM at all, it should be possible to build an aarch64 package of
kitty-bin.

The download URL is:

https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/releases/download/v0.29.0/kitty-0.29.0-arm64.txz

The md5sum is: 9f54c50e71959de17f946340a5afb7fd

The script will create a package, but I have no idea if it will
work. If you try this, please contact me (urchlay@slackware.uk) and
let me know if it works or not.
