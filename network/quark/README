quark (simple HTTP server for static content)

quark is an extremely small and simple HTTP GET/HEAD-only web server
for static content. The goal of this project is to do one thing and do
it well, namely serving static web directories and doing that right.

If you want to use a custom config.h to build quark, copy config.def.h
to config.h (in the SlackBuild directory) and edit it. The SlackBuild
will use the config.h if it exists.

quark does not natively support TLS. You can use a TLS reverse proxy
such as tlstunnel, hitch, or stunnel to add TLS support to quark.

The package doesn't include a startup script. To start quark on
boot, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local and add a section like this:

if [ -x /usr/bin/quark ]; then
  nohup /usr/bin/quark \
    -l -p 80 -u apache -g apache -d /var/www/htdocs \
    1>/var/log/quark.log 2>&1 &
fi

The example above starts quark as an apache replacement. You can
change the command-line arguments as needed, for your purposes.
