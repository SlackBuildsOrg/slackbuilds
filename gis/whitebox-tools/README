WhiteboxTools is an advanced geospatial data analysis platform
developed by Prof. John Lindsay at the University of Guelph's
Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research Group. WhiteboxTools can be
used to perform common geographical information systems (GIS) analysis
operations, such as cost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and
raster reclassification. Remote sensing and image processing tasks
include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic sharpening, contrast
adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering operations,
simple classification (k-means), and common image transformations.
WhiteboxTools also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological
analysis (e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream
network analysis, sink removal), terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain
indices such as slope, curvatures, wetness index, hillshading;
hypsometric analysis; multi-scale topographic position analysis),
and LiDAR data processing. LiDAR point clouds can be interrogated
(LidarInfo, LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined, analyized
for outliers, interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and
ground-points can be classified or filtered. WhiteboxTools is not
a cartographic or spatial data visualization package; instead it is
meant to serve as an analytical backend for other data visualization
software, mainly GIS.
