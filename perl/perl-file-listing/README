This module exports a single function called parse_dir(), which can be
used to parse directory listings.

The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse.
It can be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a
glob representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.

The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps
in the listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone
is assumed.

The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently
supported formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value
'unix'. Ideally, the listing type should be determined automatically.

The fourth parameter specifies how unparseable lines should be
treated.  Values can be 'ignore', 'warn' or a code reference. Warn
means that the perl warn() function will be called. If a code
reference is passed, then this routine will be called and the return
value from it will be incorporated in the listing. The default is
'ignore'.

Only the first parameter is mandatory.

The return value from parse_dir() is a list of directory entries. In
a scalar context the return value is a reference to the list. The
directory entries are represented by an array consisting of [
$filename, $filetype, $filesize, $filetime, $filemode ]. The $filetype
value is one of the letters 'f', 'd', 'l' or '?'. The $filetime value
is the seconds since Jan 1, 1970. The $filemode is a bitmask like the
mode returned by stat().
