The goal of the library is to be able to navigate ModDB purely 
programmatically through scraping and parsing of the various models 
present on the website. This is based off a command of my bot which can 
parse either a game or a mod, this command gave birth to the original 
library which was extremely limited in its abilities and only able to 
parse a few pages with inconsistencies. This library is a much more 
mature and professional attempt at the whole idea, adding on a much 
deeper understanding of OOP.
