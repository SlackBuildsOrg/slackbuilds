connman (Connection management daemon)

Connman provides a daemon for managing Internet connections. The
Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to use as few resources
as possible. It is fully modular system that can be extended through
plug-ins. The plug-in approach allows for easy adaption and
modification for various use cases. Connman implements DNS resolving
and caching, DHCP clients for both IPv4 and IPv6, link-local IPv4
address handling and tethering (IP connection sharing) to clients via
USB, ethernet, WiFi, cellular and Bluetooth.

Included with this SlackBuild is a README.SBo file which includes
some details on how to setup connman. This file is also installed
into the package's documentation directory.

By default, this SlackBuild will build connman with support for iwd,
polkit, and nmcompat (NetworkManager compatibility interfaces). If
you wish to disable any of these, you may run the SlackBuild with
the DISABLE_IWD, DISABLE_POLKIT, and DISABLE_NMCOMPAT environment
variables set, e.g.
  DISABLE_IWD=yes DISABLE_POLKIT=yes DISABLE_NMCOMPAT=yes \
  ./connman.SlackBuild
