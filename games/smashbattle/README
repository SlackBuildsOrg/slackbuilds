So you're up for some fast, old skool, 2D, platform, shoot 'm up
action! Well, you came to the right place. Smash Battle, a game based
on the famous Mario battle from Super Mario Bros 3 on the good old
NES. The game is simple yet very addictive. Fight your way through
several missions to unlock secret characters. Battle with one, two
or even three friends in the multiplayer mode to show of your old and
dusty game skillz.
