Apache ActiveMQ is the most popular and powerful open source messaging
and Integration Patterns provider.

Apache ActiveMQ is fast, supports many Cross Language Clients and
Protocols, comes with easy to use Enterprise Integration Patterns
and many advanced features while fully supporting JMS 1.1 and J2EE
1.4. Apache ActiveMQ is released under the Apache 2.0 License.

This package provides an /etc/rc.d/rc.activemq init script to manage
the main ActiveMQ system instance. If you want to run different
instances on the same machine:

1) create the configuration file
   /etc/default/activemq-instance-<INSTANCENAME>
2) create an appropriate ACTIVEMQ_HOME
3) ln -sf /usr/share/activemq/bin/activemq \
      /usr/local/bin/activemq-instance-<INSTANCENAME>
4) use /usr/local/bin/activemq-instance-<INSTANCENAME> to
   start/stop/restart your own instance.
