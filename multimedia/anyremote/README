The overall goal of this project is to provide remote control service
on Linux through Bluetooth, InfraRed, Wi-Fi or TCP/IP connection.

anyRemote supports wide range of modern cell phones line Nokia,
SonyEricsson, Motorola and others.

anyRemote was developed as a thin "communication" layer between
Buetooth (IR, Wi-Fi)-capabled phone and Linux, and in principle could
be configured to manage almost any software.

anyRemote could be used with:
    * bluetooth connection with java client if cell phone is JSR82
      compatible
    * Wi-Fi connection with java client if phone supports Wi-Fi
    * IR connection with java client if java in phone supports access
      to IR port
    * TCP/IP connection with java client, if PC is connectable from
      internet
    * bluetooth, infrared or cable connection using AT "modem" commands
    * web interface
    * it supports some of IR remotes supplied with TV tuner cards (like
      LIRC)
    * it has limited support for Bemused clients
