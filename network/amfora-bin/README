amfora-bin (gemini client)

Amfora aims to be the best looking Gemini client with the most
features... all in the terminal. It does not support Gopher or other
non-Web protocols. It fully passes Sean Conman's client torture test,
as well as the Egsam one.

This is a repack of the official binary; it does not compile from
source. Only 32-bit x86, 64-bit x86_64, and 64-bit aarch64 are
supported.

For aarch64, since there's currently no way to give the aarch64 download
URL in the .info file, you'll have to download it manually. The file is:

https://github.com/makew0rld/amfora/releases/download/v1.9.2/amfora_1.9.2_linux_arm64

...and its md5sum is: 5f647762170e9e30df6d0744ec8a21bc

Note: currently there is no amfora build that compiles from source.
If someday someone submits one, be aware that it will likely conflict
with this build.
