The GNU unifont has a glyph for every printable code point in the
Unicode Basic Multilinguial Plane(BMP). The BMP is the first Unicode
"plane" of 65,536(16bit) code points, and includes character encoding
for most of the world's modern scripts.

By default, the package will include precompiled versions of the
font in TTF (TrueType), PCF (X Window bitmap) and PSF (console)
formats. This can be changed using FONTFORMATS environment variable,
which should be set to comma-separated list of font formats to include
in the package.

Available formats are:

ttf = TrueType
pcf = X Window bitmap
psf = Console fonts
otb = OpenType Bitmap fonts, compatible with recent versions of Pango
      which don't support PCF fonts. Fonts in this format are generated
      by converting precompiled PCF fonts using fonttosfnt tool.

For example, setting FONTFORMATS=pcf,psf will include only PCF and
PSF fonts. If FONTFORMATS variable is not set the default value
"ttf,pcf,psf" is assumed.
