# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

convmv: convmv (convert filenames to utf8 or any other charset)
convmv:
convmv: convmv converts filenames (not file content), directories, and even
convmv: whole filesystems to a different encoding. Though it's primarily
convmv: written to convert from/to UTF-8, it can also be used with almost any
convmv: other charset encoding. Convmv can also be used for case conversion
convmv: from upper to lower case and vice versa with virtually any charset.
