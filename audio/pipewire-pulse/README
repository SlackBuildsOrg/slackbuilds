Take over audio/media system totally by Pipewire this time!

Important Notes:
Blacklist following packages to prevent any reinstall for this package:

daemon
pulseaudio

Or, just don't accept any .NEW configs from pulse while you upgrade by
slackpkg.

In case you want to switch back to pulseaudio, you need to execute this
build with "disable" option for Pipewire:

$ PIPEWIRE=disable ./pipewire-pulse.SlackBuild

You need to reboot or atleast re-login, so changes appear.
