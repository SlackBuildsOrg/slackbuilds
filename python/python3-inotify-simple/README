inotify-simple

inotify_simple is a simple Python wrapper around inotify. No fancy bells
and whistles, just a literal wrapper with ctypes. Only ~100 lines of
code!

inotify_init1() is wrapped as a file-like object, INotify(), holding the
inotify file descriptor. INotify().read() reads available data from the
file descriptor and returns events as namedtuple objects after unpacking
them with the struct module. inotify_add_watch() and inotify_rm_watch()
are wrapped with no changes at all, taking and returning watch
descriptor integers that calling code is expected to keep track of
itself, just as one would use inotify from C.
