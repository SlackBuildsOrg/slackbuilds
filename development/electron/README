electron (Library for building cross-platform applications)

Electron is an open source library developed by GitHub for building
cross-platform desktop applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Electron accomplishes this by combining Chromium and Node.js into a
single runtime, and apps can be packaged for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

This is electron binary repackaged in Slackware style. This SlackBuild
is for version 33 of Electron. The binary for Electron 33 is only
available for x86_64, arm64 and arm7vl systems.

Optional features

INSTALL_ZIP (default=no): Install zip packaged version of electron,
this install a copy of the zip in your system; you can use it later
for build binary applications, if you are developer; otherwise
you not will need it.

If you need to use the option 'INSTALL_ZIP' do something like:

INSTALL_ZIP=yes ./electron.SlackBuild

You can see README.Slackware for more instructions to use it.
