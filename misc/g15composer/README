G15Composer is a scriptable command interface to the libg15render
drawing functions that outputs to a G15daemon screen. G15composer
exposes all graphics primitives and text rendering functions of
libg15render so that they may be used in a variety of situations,
including from the command line or in virtually any scripting
language. As a G15Daemon client, it requires that the daemon is
installed and running.
