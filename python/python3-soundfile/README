python3-soundfile (Audio library based on libsndfile, CFFI, and NumPy)

The soundfile module is an audio library based on libsndfile, CFFI
and NumPy.

The soundfile module can read and write sound files. File
reading/writing is supported through libsndfile, which is a free,
cross-platform, open-source (LGPL) library for reading and writing
many different sampled sound file formats that runs on many platforms
including Windows, OS X, and Unix. It is accessed through CFFI,
which is a foreign function interface for Python calling C code.
