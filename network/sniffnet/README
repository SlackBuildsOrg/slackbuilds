sniffnet (Comfortably monitor your Internet traffic)

Sniffnet is a network monitoring tool to help you
easily keep track of your Internet traffic.

Note that if you are not running as root, you need 
to set capabilities to inspect a network adapter:

  # setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/sniffnet
