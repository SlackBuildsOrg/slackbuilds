Bcachefs is a modern copy-on-write filesystem for Linux offering 
advanced features like snapshots, checksumming, compression, 
and encryption.

This package only provides userspace utilities for bcachefs 
management.  Bcachefs support should also be enabled in your kernel
(compiled directly in, as a module, or preferably via DKMS).

Bcachefs userspace tools require libblkid and blkid versions that
are newer than that available in Slackware 15.0.  The build script 
handles this by temporarily compiling libblkid for static linking 
without installing it system-wide.

The script will also install an updated blkid binary as
/sbin/blkid.bcachefs to provide the functionality needed without
conflicting with the system blkid.

If you are running Slackware-current or have a custom setup with
util-linux >= 2.40.1 installed, you can skip building libblkid
and blkid by setting NEW_UTIL_LINUX as follows:

NEW_UTIL_LINUX=yes ./bcachefs-tools.SlackBuild

Note: Requires a recent/updated kernel-headers package installed.
