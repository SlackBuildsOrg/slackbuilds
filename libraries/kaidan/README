Kaidan is a simple, user-friendly and modern chat client.


It uses the open communication protocol XMPP (Jabber). The user
interface makes use of Kirigami and QtQuick, while the back-end of
Kaidan is entirely written in C++ using Qt and the Qt-based XMPP
library QXmpp. Kaidan runs on mobile and desktop systems including
Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, Plasma Mobile and Ubuntu Touch.

 Kaidan does not have all basic features yet and has still some
stability issues. Do not expect it to be as good as the currently
dominating instant messaging clients.

This version, 0.8.0 (2021) is the most recent supported on Slackware
15.0
