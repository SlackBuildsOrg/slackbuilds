# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Email-Abstract: perl-Email-Abstract (unified interface to mail representations)
perl-Email-Abstract:
perl-Email-Abstract: Email::Abstract provides module writers with the ability to write
perl-Email-Abstract: simple, representation-independent mail handling code. For instance,
perl-Email-Abstract: in the cases of Mail::Thread or Mail::ListDetector, a key part of the
perl-Email-Abstract: code involves reading the headers from a mail object. Where previously
perl-Email-Abstract: one would either have to specify the mail class required, or to build
perl-Email-Abstract: a new object from scratch, Email::Abstract can be used to perform
perl-Email-Abstract: certain simple operations on an object regardless of its underlying
perl-Email-Abstract: representation.
