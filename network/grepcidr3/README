grepcidr (Filter IP addresses matching CIDR specification)

grepcidr can be used to filter a list of IP addresses against one or
more CIDR specifications, or network address ranges.  As with grep,
there are options to invert matching, and load patterns from a file.
grepcidr is capable of comparing millions of IPs to networks with
little memory usage and in reasonable computation time.
