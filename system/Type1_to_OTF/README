Type1_to_OTF converts most of the Type1 (Postscript) fonts in
/usr/share/fonts/Type1 to OTF fonts in /usr/share/fonts/OTF.

Libreoffice 5.3 no longer supports Type1 fonts.  This SlackBuild will
convert a number of popular Type1 fonts (including Bitstream Charter and
Courier) to OTF, so that they are compatible with Libreoffice 5.3.

The only fonts not converted are ones that Libreoffice can't render
(e.g. dingbats), or that Libreoffice already offers (e.g. luxi mono).
Some italic variants are not converted, but Libreoffice can synthesize
and display them anyway.
