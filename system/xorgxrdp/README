** xorgxrdp ** is a collection of modules to be used with
a pre-existing X.Org install to make the X server act like
X11rdp. Unlike X11rdp, you don't have to recompile the whole X Window
System. Instead, additional modules are installed to a location where
the existing Xorg installation would pick them.

xorgxrdp is to be used together with xrdp and X.Org Server.
It is pretty useless using xorgxrdp alone.
xrdp needs to be installed before xorgxrdp.
