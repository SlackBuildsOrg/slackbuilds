premake5 (build configuration tool)

Premake is a command line utility which reads a scripted definition of
a software project and, most commonly, uses it to generate project
files for toolsets like Visual Studio, Xcode, or GNU Make.

Use the built-in general purpose Lua scripting engine (plus lots of 
extras) to make build configuration tasks a breeze.
