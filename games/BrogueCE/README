BrogueCE is a beautiful roguelike, although it is "text based" like
other roguelikes, it uses a very colorful and user friendly interface.

By default the ASCII version of BrogueCE is built, it sacrifices little
in terms of esthetics while being compatible with any terminal. If you
want the SDL version instead, change make TERMINAL=YES bin/brogue in
the SlackBuild script to make bin/brogue.

Have fun!
