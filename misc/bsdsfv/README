bsdsfv - is an all-in-one SFV utility (command line)

bsdsfv is an fork of pdsfv (former Hoopy SFV)
You can use bsdsfv on your own computer as well as on your site.
It is known to be very flexible and can be used by other programs.
It is released under the terms of the BSD license.

Compile time option: by default, bsdsfv is built with color output
support, which is very useful if you're checking big sfv files to find
errors fast. You can export COLOR=no in the script's environment if
you don't want color output.

Note: there's no man page for bsdsfv. The documentation can be found
in /usr/doc/bsdsfv-$VERSION/MANUAL instead.
