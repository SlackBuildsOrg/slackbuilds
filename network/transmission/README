transmission (bittorrent client)

Transmission is a lightweight open source BitTorrent client, providing
useful functionality without feature bloat. It consists of a daemon
and GTK+, Qt, and CLI clients.

By default, everything but the Qt client is built. It can be enabled
by exporting QT=yes in the environment. The other parts can be
disabled by exporting one or more environment variables:

GTK=no
CLI=no
DAEMON=no

Hint: if you use QT=yes, you probably also want GTK=no.

At least one component must be enabled (all 4 set to "no" won't work).
