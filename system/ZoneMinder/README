ZoneMinder is a Linux video camera security and surveillance solution.

This suite is intended for use in single or multi-camera video
security applications, commercial or home CCTV. It supports capture,
analysis, recording, and monitoring of video data. PTZ cameras
can be controlled via web or semi-automatically using a variety of
protocols. It can also be integrated into a home automation system
via X.10 or other protocols. This build includes cambozola and
jscalendar.

Optional dependencies are php-apcu (to enable the ZoneMinder API),
perl-Archive-Zip (automatic event uploading), perl-Device-SerialPort 
(RS232/RS485 PTZ camera control), perl-MIME-Lite, and perl-MIME-Entity
(automatic event mail notification).

See README.SLACKWARE for configuration information.
