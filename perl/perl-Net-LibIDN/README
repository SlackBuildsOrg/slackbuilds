Net::LibIDN - Perl bindings for GNU Libidn

Provides bindings for GNU Libidn, a C library for handling
Internationalized Domain Names according to IDNA (RFC 3490), in a way
very much inspired by Turbo Fredriksson's PHP-IDN. There is currently
no support for Perl's unicode capabilities (man perlunicode). All
input strings are assumed to be octet strings, all output strings
are generated as octet strings. Thus, if you require Perl's unicode
features, you will have to convert your strings manually. For example:

 use Encode;
 use Data::Dumper;
 print Dumper(Net::LibIDN::idn_to_unicode('xn--uro-j50a.com', 'utf-8'));
 print Dumper(decode(
       'utf-8',
       Net::LibIDN::idn_to_unicode('xn--uro-j50a.com',
       'utf-8')));
