Pikepdf is a Python library for reading and writing PDF files.
It is based on QPDF, a powerful PDF manipulation and repair
library. This library is similar to PyPDF2 and pdfrw - it provides
low level access to PDF features and allows editing and content
transformation of existing PDFs. Some knowledge of the PDF
specification may be helpful. It does not have the capability to
render a PDF to image.

A whole slew of extra dependencies is needed for building the docs.
To minimize the dependency list, this build script will not do this.
