curl-quic is a version of curl which supports QUIC and HTTP/3

This version is identical to curl provided by Slackware,
but supports QUIC and HTTP/3 via nghttp3 and ngtcp2 found on SBo.

ECH is still not supported.

Test that QUIC works by

curl-quic -v --http3-only https://cloudflare-quic.com

or any other QUIC-enabled website.
