LuaLDAP is a simple interface for Lua to an LDAP client, in fact it is a
bind to OpenLDAP client or ADSI.

It enables a Lua program to:
  - Connect to an LDAP server
  - Execute any operation (search, add, compare, delete, modify, and
    rename)
  - Retrieve entries and references of the search result

This package is required for LDAP authentication with prosody.
