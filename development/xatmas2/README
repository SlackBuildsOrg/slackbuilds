Xatmas2 is a cross-assembler for modern systems to cross-assemble
original source code for the Atmas II assembler for the Atari 8-bit
series, once a popular assembler in the eighties and nineties.

The manual for the original Atari 8-bit Atmas II, plus some
example source code written for xatmas2, are included in:

If you want to run the xatmas2 self-test suite, pass TEST=yes
