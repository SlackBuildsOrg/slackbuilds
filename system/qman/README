qman (TUI viewer of manual pages)

qman is a manual page viewer that can both display a specific manual
page and help find the one you need.

Its command-line interface is similar to that of man and controls are
familiar to users of less or Vim.

qman features include hyperlinks, navigation history, table of
contents, incremental search, themes.

Build options:
 - LIBBSD: values={enabled,disabled}, default=enabled
   Setting this to "disabled" allows building without installing libbsd
   which isn't necessary on Slackware current.
