Pmacct is a small set of multi-purpose passive network monitoring
tools. It can account, classify, aggregate, replicate and export
forwarding-plane data, ie. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; collect and
correlate control-plane data via BGP and BMP; collect infrastructure
data via Streaming Telemetry.

Each component works both as a standalone daemon and as a thread of
execution for correlation purposes (ie. enrich NetFlow with BGP data).
