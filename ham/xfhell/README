xfhell is a GTK+ application for the "fuzzy" digital communication
mode known as Hellschreiber. xfhell has several different built-in
fonts in Adobe BDF format, including a font set for Greek, and
a special "short" font set that is 12 pixels high instead of the
standard 14 of the original Hell fonts. Using this font set would make
xfhell incompatible with other Hellschreiber programs, but the short
fonts speed up operation and avoid wasted bandwidth, inherent in the
original Hellschreiber design (an unavoidable problem of the original
mechanical implementation of the mode).  xfhell also has selectable
lower baud rate operation (down to 7.6 Bd), which again make it
incompatible with other Hellschreiber programs, but the lower speeds
(especially combined with the 12-pixel fonts) would make this mode
even more efficient and effective.

xfhell has built-in CAT control for the FT847 and FT857 transceivers
and a QSO logging facility similar to xpsk31. It also has a
FFT-derived waterfall display of the incoming signal, with the ability
to detect maximum signal level and tune the transceiver, via CAT, to
the appropriate carrier frequency by clicking near the signal trace.

By default, xfhell wants to install a directory structure in the $HOME
of the installing user. The SlackBuild overrides this, and copies that
structure into /usr/share/xfhell-$VERSION/.
