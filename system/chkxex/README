chkxex (print info about Atari 8-bit executable files)

chkxex reads an Atari 8-bit segmented executable ("xex" file) and
prints the start address, end address, and length of each segment. Any
run or init addresses are also displayed. Output is in hexadecimal.

Input files can be standard Atari DOS 2.0S compatible executables, or
DOS-specific formats for SpartaDOS X and XBIOS.

The code has been patched slightly: in case of error, it will exit
with nonzero status.

See the man page for more information.

from atarisio.
