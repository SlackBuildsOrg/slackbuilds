liblxi is an open source software library which offers a simple API for
communicating with LXI compatible instruments. The API allows applications to
discover instruments on your network, send SCPI commands, and receive
responses.

Currently the library supports VXI-11/TCP and RAW/TCP connections. Future work
include adding support for the newer and more efficient HiSlip protocol which
is used by next generation LXI instruments.

The library is based on the VXI-11 RPC protocol implementation which is part
of the asynDriver EPICS module, which, at time of writing, is available from:
