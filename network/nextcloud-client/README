The Nextcloud Client is a file synchronization desktop utility. It
synchronizes files on your local computer, tablet, or hand-held device
with a Nextcloud Server. If you make a change to the files on one
device, the change is propagated to all other synchronized devices
using the desktop synchronization clients.

Normally, you start the client by clicking on the desktop icon or
by starting it from the client application menu. After starting, a
Nextcloud icon appears in the computer system tray or on your tablet
or handheld device.

Nextcloud is an actively maintained fork of ownCloud.
