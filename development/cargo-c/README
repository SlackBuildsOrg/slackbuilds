cargo-c is an extension for Cargo, the Rust package manager, that
helps to build and install C-ABI compatible dynamic and static
libraries. It produces and installs a correct pkg-config file, a
static library and a dynamic library, and a C header to be used
by any C (and C-compatible) software.

rust16 is needed only at build time.
