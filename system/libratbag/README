libratbag provides ratbagd, a DBus daemon to configure input devices,
mainly high-end and gaming mice.

If Sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme are installed, then the SlackBuild
will build HTML documentation files as well.

This SlackBuild disables build tests by default. To enable build tests
(valgrind additionally required), pass TESTS=yes to the SlackBuild:
TESTS=yes ./libratbag.SlackBuild
