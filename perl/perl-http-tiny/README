HTTP::Tiny - A small, simple, correct HTTP/1.1 client

This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed for doing simple
requests without the overhead of a large framework like LWP::UserAgent.

It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports
proxies and redirection. It also correctly resumes after EINTR.

If IO::Socket::IP 0.25 or later is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use it
instead of IO::Socket::INET for transparent support for both IPv4 and
IPv6.

Cookie support requires HTTP::CookieJar or an equivalent class.
