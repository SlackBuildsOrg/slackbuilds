SLADE (DOOM editor)

SLADE is a modern editor for DOOM-engine based games and source
ports. It has the ability to view, modify and write many different
game-specific formats, and even convert between some of them.

For SLADE to be useful, you'll have to install the game data (IWAD
file) from at least one of the supported games.

Note: for SLADE to build, you must have a wxWidgets that was built
with nanosvg support. If you build & install the dependencies in order
(nanosvg first), this will take care of itself. If you already had
wxWidgets installed without nanosvg support, the SLADE build will fail
(and you can easily fix it by rebuilding wxWidgets after you install
nanosvg).
