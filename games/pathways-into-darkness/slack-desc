# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pathways-into-darkness:
pathways-into-darkness: This is a full port of the 1993 Mac game "Pathways Into Darkness" by
pathways-into-darkness: Bungie to the Aleph One engine. It's somewhat of a precursor to the
pathways-into-darkness: Marathon games, and combines elements of the first-person shooter and
pathways-into-darkness: roleplaying game genres.
