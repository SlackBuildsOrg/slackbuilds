# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

waypipe: waypipe (Network transparency with Wayland)
waypipe:
waypipe: waypipe is a proxy for Wayland[0] clients. It forwards Wayland
waypipe: messages and serializes changes to shared memory buffers over a
waypipe: single socket. This makes application forwarding similar to
waypipe: ssh -X [1] feasible.
