pysolfc-extra-cardsets (extra card graphics for pysolfc)

Over 100MB of extra cardsets for use with pysolfc, including large
cards for high resolution displays (or for the vision impaired).

Most of the cardsets come from the PySolFC sourceforge download page.

The "bknoll" cardsets were adapted from Byron Knoll's public-domain
card images, from "http://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards/". The
bknoll-large and bknoll-huge sets are large enough to be used on most
hi-res displays without enabling scaling in PySolFC.
