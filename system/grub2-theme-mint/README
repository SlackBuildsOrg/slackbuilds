This is the GRUB 2 theme for Linux Mint.

After installing grub2-theme-mint, please add the following lines to
/etc/default/grub:
GRUB_FONT="/boot/grub/fonts/UbuntuMono16.pf2"
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/linuxmint/theme.txt"

Note that the Ubuntu font provided by the source tarball may display
glyphs incorrectly. Other fonts (ex. Dejavu Sans Mono, GNU Unifont)
may be a better choice.
