CanAce is a fork by Lawrence Woodman of xAce featuring a
tcl frontend and some fixes to the original source.

It is an emulator for the Jupiter Ace that runs under most
flavours of Unix. It was originally written by Edward Patel and
based on a ZX81 emulator called xz81 written by Russell Marks,
which was in turn based on Ian Collier's xz80, a ZX Spectrum
emulator for X.

This CanAce Slackware version implements some modifications
to the original release including one to change between
"slow" and "fast" emulation speed by pressing the "F2" key,
very useful while spooling text sources.

If you prefer to build the vanilla
version invoke the SlackBuild as follows:

SLACKMODS=no ./CanAce.SlackBuild
