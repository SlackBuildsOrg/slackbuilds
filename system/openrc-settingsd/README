OpenRC-settingsd provides an implementation of the the hostnamed,
localed, and timedated D-Bus services for OpenRC-based systems - in
particular, for typical installations of Gentoo or Slackware Linux.

Just add /etc/rc.d/rc.openrc-settingsd start/stop to your rc.local
and rc.local_shutdown scripts.
