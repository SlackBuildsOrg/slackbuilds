A set of AI-enabled effects, generators, and analyzers for Audacity.

These AI features run 100% locally on your PC -- no internet connection
necessary!
OpenVINO is used to run AI models on supported accelerators found on
the user's system such as CPU, GPU, and NPU.

Due to the size of the openvino models, currently only two of the
effects are provided with this build:
  -Music Separation -- Separate a mono or stereo track into individual
     stems -- Drums, Bass, Vocals, & Other Instruments.
  -Noise Suppression -- Removes background noise from an audio sample.

The dependency whisper.cpp needs to be build against its optional
dependency openvino to be used by this package.
