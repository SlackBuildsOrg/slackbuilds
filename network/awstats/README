AWStats is a free, powerful and featureful tool that generates
advanced web streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically.
AWStats works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible
information your log contains, in few graphical web pages.  It can
analyze log files from all major server tools like Apache log files
and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers
and some ftp servers.

There's an automated script (awstats_configure.pl) to prepare the
httpd config file located in DOCROOT/awstats/ - however, you should
not need/want to run it; instead, everything should work well if you
make the changes listed below.

Edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf (this is a required change to use AWStats):
Comment this out:     CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/access_log" common
Uncomment this:       CustomLog "/var/log/httpd/access_log" combined

Short How-to for using AWStats as CGI:

Add the following include line /etc/httpd/httpd.conf:
Include /etc/httpd/extra/httpd-awstats.conf
You need to load mod_cgid.so and mod_cgi.so modules

Then restart httpd:   "/etc/rc.d/rc.httpd restart"

A sample config file will be placed in /etc/awstats; Make some
necessary changes and please read the necessary steps to start awstats
from online page starting from step 4:
