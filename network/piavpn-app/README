The Private Internet Access (PIA) desktop app is a user-friendly and
highly customizable Virtual Private Network (VPN) client for desktop
operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. It encrypts your
internet traffic and routes it through a secure server to protect
your online identity and data.

The PIA application requires the piavpn and piahnsd groups to exist
before running the daemon. You can create these groups as root with:

groupadd piavpn
groupadd piahnsd

To start or stop the PIA daemon automatically at boot, add the
following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.piavpn ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.piavpn start
fi

By default, this package configures PIA’s WireGuard interface to be
unmanaged by NetworkManager. This is the recommended setup, as the
PIA app manages both WireGuard and OpenVPN connections internally.
If you prefer NetworkManager to manage the connection instead, you
can build the package with the following option:

NMMANAGER=yes ./piavpn-app.SlackBuild

There is very little reason to let NetworkManager manage the
connection, since that’s handled entirely by the app itself.
Unless you know you need NetworkManager integration for a specific
setup, you should leave it unmanaged.
