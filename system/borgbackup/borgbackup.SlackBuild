# 20230809 bkw: Modified by SlackBuilds.org, BUILD=2:
# - stop the build from failing if Sphinx is installed but
#   guzzle_sphinx_theme is not.
# - always include man pages in package (upstream kindly included
#   prebuilt ones in the tarball).
# - clean up optional deps for HTML docs in README. python3-attrs
#   is not required, and alabaster + imagesize are already required
#   deps for Sphinx.
# - make slack-desc say whether the HTML docs are included.
