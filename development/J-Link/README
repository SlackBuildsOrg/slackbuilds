J-Link software gives you the USB drivers needed for your system,
a number of utilities as well as a dynamically linkable library used
by most of the IDEs and debuggers using J-Link. Also included are
a number of sample setup scripts for devices needing one as well as
documentation.

NOTES:

1. This SlackBuild is not _sbopkg_ compatible, because source download
   requires licence acceptance (the link provided in .info points to
   the download form). In addition, the source tarball name is
   different from the resulting package name.

2. This SlackBuild repackages the official J-Link pre-compiled
   binaries.

3. Remember to reload udev rules after installing this package:

       $ /etc/rc.d/rc.udev reload

   and then to re-plug your J-Link probe.

4. The upstream _udev_ rules change the device nodes perms to 0666.
   This SlackBuild updates the rules, so that the permissions are set
   to 0664 and group is set to _plugdev_. Be sure to make yourself
   a member of this group to use J-Link probes without _root_.
   The same perms/group is applied to the J-Link embedded serial ports
   device nodes as well.

5. If you're looking for replacing ST-LINK/V2 on ST Discovery or
   Nucleo boards with J-Link, see [here]. It requires Windows
   to perform the update, but can be done using QEMU with usbredir.
   Such a converted board is used for testing the J-Link package
   on my Slackware machine.
