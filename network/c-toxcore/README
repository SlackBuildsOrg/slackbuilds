Tox is a free (as in liberty and price) peer to peer, distributed,
multimedia messenger. Tox can provide a superior instant
messaging experience than current market offerings by using
existing technologies such as dispersed networking and strong
cryptography. Files can be shared as fast as you and your partner's
Internet connection allows, audio calls are instantaneous, and there
are no arbitrary limits to how many people you can have in a group
conversation.

This is a fork of the original irungentoo/toxcore. Toxcore developer
has been unable to find time to work on it and a non-hostile fork was
created.

Additional libconfig dependency is needed for tox-bootstrapd daemon,
together with:

  DAEMON=yes ./c-toxcore.SlackBuild

NOTE: Please remove the original toxcore package before installing
c-toxcore.
