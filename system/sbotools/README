sbotools (ports-like interface to SlackBuilds.org)

sbotools is a set of Perl scripts providing a ports-like automation
interface to SlackBuilds.org. Features include dependency handling,
using a custom git branch, generating 32-bit and compat32 builds on
multilib systems, reverse dependency search and rebuild, dry run and
batch modes, gpg verification, optional build logging and more.

Each included command has a man page. See sbotools(1) for executive
summaries and a startup guide. The modules are documented in man 3.

Configuration files from version 2.7 are compatible, but some of the
options are new. sbotools2 configuration files are mostly compatible.
It may be convenient to examine the new /etc/sbotools/sbotools.conf
file for added options and annotation when upgrading from version 2.x.
Alternatively, run "sboconfig" without flags and options for an
interactive menu with explanations of all settings.

To blacklist scripts, notify sbotools of optional dependencies and
request automatic reverse dependency rebuilds, see sbohints(1) or
/etc/sbotools/sbotools.hints.

Please note that sbotools-3.x was forked from sbotools-2.7. A debt of
gratitude is owed to original author Jacob Pipkin, longtime maintainer
Andreas Guldstrand and major contributor Luke Williams.

sbotools conflicts with system/sbotools2 (Legacy Sbotools).
