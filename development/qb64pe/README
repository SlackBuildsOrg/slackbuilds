QB64 Phoenix Edition (QB64-PE) is a fork of QB64.com, providing
additional features and enhancements, maintained by a
group of original developers of QB64.com.

QB64-PE is a modern extended BASIC programming language with embedded
OpenGL support that retains QuickBASIC 4.5 and QBasic compatibility
and compiles native binaries for Windows (Vista and up),
Linux and macOS.

Unlike traditional BASIC and QBasic code, QB64pe gets compiled
automatically into machine code â€“ allowing exceptional performance,
easy distribution, and the ability to link with external C and C++
programming libaries. Compatible with most QBasic 4.5 code, QB64pe
adds a number of extensions, such as OpenGL and other modern
features, providing the perfect blend of classic and modern
program development.

On first run this package installs ~/.config/qb64pe-(version)
in $HOME in order to run the program and its data.
You can delete this directory and rebuild you local configuration
by relaunching the program.
