UUDeview is a program that helps you transmit and receive binary
files over the Internet, using electronic mail or newsgroups The
UUDeview package includes both an encoder and a decoder. The decoder
automatically detects the type of encoding used, offering MIME's
Base64 and BinHex as well as the popular uuencoding and the less
frequently used xxencoding methods.  Recently, support for the popular
yEnc encoding was also added. The encoder runs the other way around
and encodes a binary file for sending it by mail or news.
