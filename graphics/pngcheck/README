pngcheck (check integrity of PNG files)

pngcheck verifies the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files (by checking
the internal 32-bit CRCs, a.k.a. checksums, and decompressing the
image data); it can optionally dump almost all of the chunk-level
information in the image in human-readable form. For example, it can
be used to print the basic statistics about an image (dimensions,
bit depth, etc.); to list the color and transparency info in its
palette (assuming it has one); or to extract the embedded text
annotations. This is a command-line program with batch capabilities.
