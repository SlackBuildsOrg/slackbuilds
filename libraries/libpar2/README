libpar2 allows for the generation, modification, verification of PAR
v1.0 and PAR v2.0(PAR2) sets used for recovery when data is lost or
corrupted. When used with collections of files, some missing files can
be regenerated.

The code was initially extracted from the program par2cmdline (also
available at SlackBuilds) to allow developers to use it.
