elasticsearch5 (Official low level python client for Elasticsearch)

Official low-level client for Elasticsearch.

Its goal is to provide common ground for all Elasticsearch-related
code in Python; because of this it tries to be opinion-free and very
extendable.

It provides a more convenient and idiomatic way to write and
manipulate queries. It stays close to the Elasticsearch JSON DSL,
mirroring its terminology and structure while exposing the whole range
of the DSL from Python either directly using defined classes or a
queryset-like expressions.

It also provides an optional persistence layer for working with
documents as Python objects in an ORM-like fashion: defining mappings,
retrieving and saving documents, wrapping the document data in
user-defined classes.
