wxWidgets is a cross-platform API for writing GUI applications
on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's
controls and utilities.

Notes:

1. This package is NOT built using --enable-stl by default.
   If you need to enable stl, use:
   STL=yes ./wxWidgets.SlackBuild

2. If you need the wxWidgets API documentation, you need to
   install graphviz, then run wxWidgets.SlackBuild with
   APIDOC=yes in the environment. You won't need the API docs
   unless you're developing software.

This package provides 2 interfaces, GTK3 and Qt5.
By default, wx-config will be linked to GTK3, but if you want
to use Qt5, use INTERFACE=qt variable to override.
