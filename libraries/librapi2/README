librapi2 (SynCE library)

The RAPI library is an open source implementation that works like
RAPI.DLL, available on Microsoft operating systems. The library
makes it possible to make remote calls to a computer running
device. Documentation for the RAPI calls is available at this address:

In order to use librapi, a daemon that the device client connects to
must be running on the computer using librapi.
