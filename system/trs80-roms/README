trs80-roms (ROM images for use with sdltrs and xtrs)

This package includes ROM images for the TRS-80 Model I (Level I and
Level II BASIC), Model III, Model 4, and Model 4P.

Also included in the package are ld4-631.dsk (a bootable disk image
of the final version of LS-DOS sold by Misosys, for the Model III
and 4) two disk images with various utility software (utility.dsk
and cpmutil.dsk), and newdos_80sssd_jv1.dsk (a bootable disk image of
NEWDOS-80 v2.0 for the Model I).

The sdltrs and xtrs emulators on SlackBuilds.org have been patched to
use these ROM images by default, if there's no user config file. You
can still use other ROMs by editing the config file or using the
emulator's user interface.

The copyright status of these ROM images is murky, but they've been
widely available on the 'net since the 1990s. If you own the original
TRS-80 computers, you probably can legally use the ROM images,
depending on the laws where you live.

There is a nice archive of TRS-80 Model I software available here:
