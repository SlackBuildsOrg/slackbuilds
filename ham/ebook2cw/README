ebook2cw is a command line program (optional graphical user interface 
available) which converts a plain text (ASCII, ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8) 
file (e. g. an ebook) to Morse code MP3 or OGG audio files. It works 
on several platforms, including Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

It allows heavy configuration of the output files, including CW speed,
Farnsworth spacing, tone frequency, signal-to-noise ratio, waveform,
length of file before splitting, and other parameters. It currently
backs LCWO.net and can be compiled to use as a CGI.
