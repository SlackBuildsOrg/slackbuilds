hp-wmi-sensors (hwmon sensors driver for HP business-class PCs)

Hewlett-Packard (and some HP Compaq) business-class computers report
hardware monitoring information via Windows Management Instrumentation
(WMI). This driver exposes that information to the Linux hwmon
subsystem, allowing userspace utilities like sensors to gather numeric
sensor readings.

In particular, it's required on some systems (e.g. the SlackBuild
author's HP Z2 Mini G3) for fan speeds to be visible in 'sensors'.

Slackware-specific notes:

The driver is a kernel module. By default, it's built for the
currently running kernel, but you can build it for any kernel version
if you have that kernel's modules and source installed. Set the KERNEL
environment variable to the version you want to build for.

After installation, you can load the driver immediately, with:

  /sbin/modprobe hp-wmi-sensors

To load the module on every boot, add the above command to
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local

Note that there's already an hp-wmi module in Slackware's
kernel-modules package. Loading hp-wmi-sensors will add new sensors,
if there any supported by the driver. Look at the output of the
'sensors' command before and after loading the module, to see if it
found anything supported.

Note to Slackware-current users: this build was developed and
tested on Slackware 15.0 (latest stable) with the 5.15.x series of
kernels. It may or may not work on -current. If it doesn't, I don't
want you to contact me about it *unless* you send me a patch that
fixes it.
