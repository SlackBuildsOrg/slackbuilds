this module annotates Python abstact syntax trees (ASTs) with the
positions of tokens and text in the source code that generated them

It makes it possible for tools that work with logical AST nodes to find
the particular text that resulted in those nodes, for example for
automated refactoring or highlighting.

It works with Python3 and can annotate both trees built by
ast, and those built by astroid.

This (source) is downloaded from pypi.org/projects/asttokens as the
github site may not have a complete sourcecode zip.
