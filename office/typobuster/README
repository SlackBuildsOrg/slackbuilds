typobuster (simplified text editor)

Lightweight editor with text transformations and auto-correction.

Typobuster is a simplified text editor with a wide selection of
transformations and automatic correction of common typos.

In my daily work I constantly receive texts in various formats (MS Word,
LibreOffice, email), which are supposed to be published on the web and
contain still the same typos: misplaced spaces, multiple spaces and line
breaks, German-style quotation marks, etc. Up until now, I have used
Mousepad to proofread, either manually or via search and replace, but
that was kind of waste of time. To make life easier, I developed a
simple editor that will do it automatically. It is supposed to focus on
plain text and contain the tools that an average user needs.

Optional dependency: 'gspell' for spell check capabilities &
'hunspell-xx' for your language of choice.
