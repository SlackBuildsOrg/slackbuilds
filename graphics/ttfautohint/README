ttfautohint provides 99% automated hinting process and a
platform for finely hand-hinting the last 1%. It is ideal
for web fonts and supports many scripts: Latin,Greek,Hebrew,
Devanagari,Khmer,Thai and many more.

It takes a TrueType font as the input,removes its bytecode 
instructions (if any), and returns a new font where all
glyphs are bytecode hinted using the information given by 
FreeType's auto-hinting module. The idea is to provide the 
excellent quality of the auto-hinter on platforms 
that don't use FreeType.

The library has a single API function, `TTF_autohint'; see
`lib/ttfautohint.h' for a detailed description.  
Note that the library itself won't get installed currently.

A command-line interface to the library is the `ttfautohint'
program; after compilation and installation, say

  ttfautohint --help

for usage information, or say

  man ttfautohint

Optional dependencies:

Inkscape: To convert SVG images to PDF.
pandoc-bin: To create pdf and html docs.

Note:

For this to build properly you will need to have a true login
shell in order to have a correctly populated environment
you will need to either use "su -l" when switching to root,
or source the /etc/profile script after doing "su"
