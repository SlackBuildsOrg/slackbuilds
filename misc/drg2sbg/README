This program converts the .drg proprietary file format into the open
source SBaGen format.

I-Doser is a company that produces Binaural brainwaves to simulate
different states.

The problem is that they don't provide a doser application for
Linux, and their mp3 collection is limited, with this program you can
convert the .drg file to an .sbg and then using SBaGen (an open source
application that they use as main engine to generate the tones) you
can convert it to wav and (if desired) to mp3 or similar.

This project will never be possible without the help of "The
Unofficial I-Doser Blog" and their steAlth's DRG Author by konstAnt
and khAttAm to tell the truth this is a rip off stripped version of
konstAnt and KhAttAm steAlth's DRG Author. They did all the work with
the .drg files, I just port some parts of it to C.

Optional dependency: sbagen (to play and/or convert sbg files to WAV)
