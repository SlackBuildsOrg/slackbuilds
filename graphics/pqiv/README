pqiv (powerful image viewer with minimal UI)

pqiv is a powerful GTK+ based command-line image viewer with a minimal
UI. It is highly customizable, can be fully controlled from scripts,
and has support for various file formats including PDF, Postscript,
video files and archives. It is optimized to be quick and responsive.

By default, pqiv is built with GTK+3. If you want to build with GTK+2,
export GTK2=yes in the script's environment.
