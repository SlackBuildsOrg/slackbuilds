# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cde: cde (Common Desktop Environment)
cde:
cde: The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) was the dominant desktop on 
cde: proprietary Unix systems in the 90's. In 2012 it was relicensed under 
cde: GPL2 and has seen moderst maintenance from the community. Although
cde: functional, it is of course a very old desktop, and some parts of it,
cde: such as the calendar and mail applications are not likely useful in a 
cde: modern setting. (there are security considerations too) Nevertheless,
cde: people still use it today, for nostalgia, if nothing else.
