RRDTool is the industry standard data logging and graphing
application.

This package makes all bindings that are supported on the system.
Bindings for Lua and libdbi (optional dependencies) will be made
automatically if they are detected, this can be changed with:

LUA=no LIBDBI=no ./rrdtool.SlackBuild
