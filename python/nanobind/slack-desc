# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nanobind: nanobind (nanobind: tiny & efficient C++/Python bindings)
nanobind:
nanobind: nanobind is a small binding library that exposes C++ types in
nanobind: Python and vice versa. It is reminiscent of Boost.Python and
nanobind: pybind11 and uses near-identical syntax. In contrast to these
nanobind: existing tools, nanobind is more efficient: bindings compile in a
nanobind: shorter amount of time, produce smaller binaries, and have
nanobind: better runtime performance.
