jack-rack (LADSPA effects host)

JACK Rack is an effects "rack" for the JACK low latency audio API. The
rack can be filled with LADSPA effects plugins and can be controlled
using the ALSA sequencer. It's phat; it turns your computer into an
effects box.

Optional build dependency (autodetected): liblrdf. When built with
liblrdf, jack-rack will be able to show effects by category, rather
than just an alphabetical list.

Optional build dependency: lash (pass LASH=yes to the script to enable)

Optional runtime dependency: ecasound (for /usr/bin/ecarack script)

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
