srb2 (Sonic Robo Blast 2 game)

Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a 3D open-source Sonic the Hedgehog fangame
built using a modified version of the Doom Legacy port of Doom. SRB2 is
closely inspired by the original Sonic games from the Sega Genesis, and
attempts to recreate the design in 3D. While SRB2 isn't fully completed,
it already features tons of levels, enemies, speed, and quite a lot of
the fun that the original Sonic games provided.

Note for users upgrading from version 2.1.x to 2.2.x: I had to
delete my old config (rm -rf ~/.srb2) to get the game to run without
segfaulting.
