The Point Cloud Library (or PCL) is a large scale, open project for
2D/3D image and point cloud processing. The PCL framework contains
numerous state-of-the art algorithms including filtering, feature
estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and
segmentation.  These algorithms can be used, for example, to filter
outliers from noisy data, stitch 3D point clouds together, segment
relevant parts of a scene, extract keypoints and compute descriptors
to recognize objects in the world based on their geometric appearance,
and create surfaces from point clouds and visualize them -- to name
a few.

Note on QT: Qt4 is used by default. If you only have Qt5, edit the
option -DPCL_QT_VERSION and set it to 5.
