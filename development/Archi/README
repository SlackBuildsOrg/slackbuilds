Archi (Archimate Modelling)

The Open Source modelling toolkit for creating ArchiMate models and
sketches.
Used by Enterprise Architects everywhere.

The Archi® modelling toolkit is targeted toward all levels of
Enterprise Architects and Modellers. It provides a low cost to entry
solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate
modelling language, or who are looking for an open source,
cross-platform ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or
institution and wish to engage with the language within a TOGAF® or
other Enterprise Architecture framework.

Note: You MUST remove any previous installation of Archi to avoid
error because of old plugin dependencies in the previous installation.
