This package was formerly hosted on slackbuilds.org as the
'broadcom-sta' package and was based upon a Debian patchset. I've re-
based this package on the Arch Linux package and patchset, and as
result, renamed it to 'broadcom-wl' to match.

The broadcom-wl package includes the kernel module 'wl', which contains
a Broadcom-provided proprietary kernel driver known to support the
listed chipsets.

BCM4360  (PCI ID 14e4:43a0)
BCM4352  (PCI ID 14e4:43b1)

Some of these devices are also supported by the free b43 and brcm80211
drivers.  In order to avoid conflicts /etc/modprobe.d/b43_blacklist.conf
disables these drivers.

Read the included LICENSE.txt file (placed in /usr/doc) before using the
proprietary driver.

To build the module for a kernel that isn't currently running on the
system, pass that kernel's "uname -r" output such as:

    KERNEL=4.4.67 ./broadcom-wl.SlackBuild

If you would like to name your interface eth1 instead of wlan0, either
rename the device in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules or build
the package with:

    IFNAME=eth ./broadcom-wl.SlackBuild
