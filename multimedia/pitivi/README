pitivi (video editor)

Pitivi is a Free video editor with a beautiful and intuitive user
interface, a clean codebase and a fantastic community.

It uses the gstreamer media framework, so it has support for most
audio/video formats. It includes hundreds of animated effects,
transitions and filters.

python3-librosa is an optional dependency to enable beat detection
functionality

NOTE: The starting output mentions cvtracker is an optional
dependency to enable object tracking, however, this wasn't added
to gst-plugins-bad until v1.19.2, so it will need to wait until
the next Slackware version (or -current).
