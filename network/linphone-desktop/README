Linphone is a SIP phone with a lot of features.

Since version 5 is very different from version 3, this slackbuild
exists independently from the linphone slackbuild, and does not
supersede it.

This version installs linphone into /opt/linphone-desktop, start it by

/opt/linphone-desktop/bin/linphone
