pyudev is an LGPL licensed, pure Python 2/3 binding to libudev, the
device and hardware management and information library of Linux.

Almost the complete libudev functionality is exposed. You can:

- Enumerate devices, filtered by specific criteria (pyudev.Context)
- Query device information, properties and attributes,
- Monitor devices, both synchronously and asynchronously with background
  threads, or within Qt event loops (pyudev.pyqt4, pyudev.pyside),
  glib (pyudev.glib) or the optional dependency wxPython (pyudev.wx).
