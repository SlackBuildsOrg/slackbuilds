PWman (An NCurses password management program)

PWMan is a password manager which uses gpg encryption to safeguard
your data. It provides a simple and easy to use command line
(NCurses) interface to manage, store, search and retrieve your
passwords.

The look and feel is based on Jaakko Heinonen's abook.

BEFORE USING PWMAN

While compilation does not directly require it, usage relies on
Gnu Privacy Guard (gpg) being installed. You will need to specify
a GnuPG ID the first time a user runs pwman, so this must be set up
beforehand.

There is more information on the gpg manpage, but you can probably
just run:

 % gpg --gen-key

and follow the on-screen instructions.
