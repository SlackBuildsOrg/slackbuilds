ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, is a language tool
that provides a framework for constructing recognizers, interpreters,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
actions in a variety of target languages.

This package contains the C++ runtime library only.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
