SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate
Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities
for building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple
configurations.

There are example configuration files provided with the tarball.
If you'd like to use it (at your own risk), see the different options at
http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDoc.html, rename SciTEUser.properties.new
to .SciTEUser.properties, and place it in your user's homedir.

Please look into /usr/doc/scite-3.7.4 after installation to find the
example configuration files and additional documentation.

Set the TRANSLATION variable to a valid language code to install the
locale.<language>.properties in place of the upstream one.

See
https://github.com/moltenform/scite-files/blob/main/files/translations_list.md
for a list of valid locales.
