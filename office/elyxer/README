eLyXer (pronounced elixir) is a LyX to HTML converter. Using eLyXer,
you can build a web representation of your documentation written with
LyX.

As of version 1.2.0, eLyXer is installed as a script instead of a
Python module. After installation, in Lyx, select Tools->Reconfigure
to configure the HTML export to use the new script.  The eLyXer script
may also be used from the command line.  See `elyxer --help` for more
information.
