ganglia (distributed monitoring system)

Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for
high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids.
It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations
of clusters.

1. This SlackBuild is just going to build Ganglia without 'gmetad',
   which collects information from ganglia monitor clients, and
   writes them to RRD databases. If you want to enable this, you'll
   have to enable it with the OPT variable and 'gmetad' as value,
   then execute the build script as follows:
   OPT=gmetad ./ganglia.SlackBuild

   In order to build gmetad as part of this package, you'll need
   to have RRDTool installed.  It is available from SlackBuilds.org.

2. The Ganglia web frontend is distributed as a separated SlackBuild:
   ganglia-web.
