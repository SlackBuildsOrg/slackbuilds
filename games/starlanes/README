This simple game has a long history, Star Trader was written by Dave
Kaufman in BASIC in 1974. Steven Farber wrote a clone called Star
Lanes for the computer magazine Interface Age. This version, from
1997, is a C port of Starlanes  for the Osborne 1. It is a very old
game, but the code is simple and compiles easily on modern systems.
