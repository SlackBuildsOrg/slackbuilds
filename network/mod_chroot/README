mod_chroot allows you to run Apache in a chroot jail with no
additional files.  This makes running Apache in a chroot environment
easy.

The chroot() system call is performed at the end of startup procedure
- when all libraries are loaded and log files open. No need for
a special directory hierarchy (containing /dev, /lib, /etc...),
unless an external handler, such as suEXEC or suPHP, is being used,
or system()-like functions are in use.

This package pre-creates /var/chroot/httpd with just enough subdirs
to enable the stock Slackware config to run. You'll need to add the
following line to your /etc/httpd/httpd.conf file:
  Include /etc/httpd/extra/mod_chroot.conf

You'll also need to add the following lines to your /etc/fstab file:
  /var/run/httpd /var/chroot/httpd/var/run/httpd none bind
  /srv /var/chroot/httpd/srv none bind
  /var/www /var/chroot/httpd/var/www none bind
