stuntrally (game based on VDrift and OGRE, with Track Editor)

The game features 191 tracks in 34 sceneries and 28 vehicles. Game
modes include: single race, tutorials, championships, challenges,
multiplayer and split screen. Replays and Ghost drive are available.
The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.

The game aims at a rally style of driving (like in Richard Burns
Rally), with possible stunt elements (jumps, loops, pipes).

This is currently repackaging the binary version until stuntrally can be
ported to ogre-1.11+.
