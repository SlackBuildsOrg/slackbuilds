jack (realtime low-latency sound server)

JACK is a system for handling real-time, low latency audio and MIDI.
It can connect a number of different applications to an audio device,
as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves.

Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal apps), or
within the JACK server (ie. as a "plugin"). JACK also has support for
distributing audio processing across a network, both fast & reliable
LANs as well as slower, less reliable WANs.

This package includes both jack and jack-example-tools.

Note: This build conflicts with jack1: install only one of the two.
JACK's developers recommend not using jack1 at all, although it's still
maintained.

Note: this build was formerly known as jack2. Before installing this,
"removepkg jack2" if you had it installed.

SBo build maintainers, please list jack (not jack1) as a dependency for
your builds. If the software you're trying to build really does work
with jack1 but not jack, please contact the jack maintainer (currently
B. Watson <urchlay@slackware.uk>. Include the build log and any runtime
error messages in your email, plase.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.

Optional dependencies are celt, libffado, zita-alsa-pcmi, and
zita-resampler.
