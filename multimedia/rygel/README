Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, 
video and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. 
In technical terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer 
implemented through a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other 
devices in the market is achieved by conformance to very strict 
requirements of DLNA and on the fly conversion of media to format that 
client devices are capable of handling.

Note: On Slackware the rygel daemon must be started and stopped 
manually. There are controls to start/stop the daemon in the
gnome-control-center "Sharing" panel, but these controls are hard-coded
to talk to systemd and will not start/stop the daemon. Instead, the 
daemon can be run directly from its installed path of:

 /usr/bin/rygel
