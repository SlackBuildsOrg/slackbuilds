# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rmw:
rmw: rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove utility for the command line.
rmw: Its goal is to conform to the FreeDesktop.org Trash specification and
rmw: therefore be compatible with KDE, GNOME, XFCE, and others. Desktop
rmw: integration is optional however, and by default, rmw will only use a
rmw: waste folder separated from your desktop trash. One of its unique
rmw: features is the ability to purge files from your Waste/Trash
rmw: directories after x number of days.
