# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zxbasic: zxbasic (basic compiler for ZXSpectrum)
zxbasic:
zxbasic: ZX BASIC is a BASIC "cross compiler". It will compile BASIC
zxbasic: programs (in your PC) for your ZX Spectrum. ZX BASIC is an
zxbasic: SDK entirely written in python. The SDK is implemented using
zxbasic: the PLY (Python Lex/Yacc) compiler tool. It translates BASIC
zxbasic: to Z80 assembler code, so it is easily portable to other Z80
zxbasic: platforms (Amstrad, MSX). Other non Z80 targets could also
zxbasic: be available in the future.
