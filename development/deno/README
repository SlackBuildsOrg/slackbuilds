Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. It's built
on V8, Rust, and Tokio.

This script builds only half of Deno from source, the V8 engine itself
is downloaded from github in a binary form. Patches to build itself
from source are welcomed by the SlackBuild author.

In particular, this package should be useful for a new (circa 2025)
generation of yt-dlp.
