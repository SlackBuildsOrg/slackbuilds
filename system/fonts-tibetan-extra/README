The Tibetan script is a segmental writing system (abugida)
of Indic origin used to write certain Tibetic languages,
including Tibetan, Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, Jirel and Balti.
It has also been used for some non-Tibetic languages in
close cultural contact with Tibet, such as Thakali and Old Turkic.
The printed form is called uchen script while the hand-written
cursive form used in everyday writing is called umÃª script.
