To run under inetd, add this line to your /etc/inetd.conf and then
restart or kill -HUP the inetd process:

gopher  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/in.gophernicus  in.gophernicus -h <your-hostname>

To run under xinetd, just restart or kill -HUP the xinetd process
after installing the package. This assumes you already have xinetd
installed and running.
