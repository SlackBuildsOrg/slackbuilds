Resampling (reprojection) of geospatial image data in Python.

Pyresample uses a kd-tree approach for resampling.
Pyresample is designed for resampling of remote sensing data
and supports resampling from both fixed grids and geolocated
swath data.

Optional dependencies: numexpr, quicklook (not available from SBo)

NOTE: Cython will not be used by default. Set environment variable
'USE_CYTHON=True' to use it.
