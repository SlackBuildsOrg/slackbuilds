Minitube is a YouTube desktop client. With it you can watch YouTube
videos in a new way: you type a keyword, Minitube gives you an endless
video stream. Minitube does not require the Flash Player. Minitube
is not about cloning the original YouTube web interface, it aims to
create a new TV-like experience.
