alt.sysadmin.recovery manual pages

A set of humorous manual pages developed on alt.sysadmin.recovery
(don't treat them seriously!). They document a set of really
useful tools that for some strange reason are not included in any
implementation of Unix. This includes such famous commands as lart,
sysadmin, luser, bosskill and others.

The authors recommend these man pages should be installed on every
system.
