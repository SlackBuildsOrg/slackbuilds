The Edit&Share application is used to control Zoom G3/B3 pedals from
your favourite Slackware box.

The Zoom G3/B3 guitar pedals opens the door to a new creativity level.
It offers a number of effects, along with amp and cabinet models,
and allows you to chain them together for full multi-effect complexity.

Three stompbox-style displays—each with its own dedicated foot switch
and control knobs—make it easy to edit effects and bring them in and
out as needed.

Advanced features like an onboard chromatic tuner, balanced line-level
output, USB port, and integrated rhythm patterns and looper complete
the picture.

Both onstage and in the studio, you can count on your G3 to deliver
the great sound you need from a guitar pedal.
