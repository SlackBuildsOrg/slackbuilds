puNES (NES emulator)

puNES is a Nintendo Entertaiment System emulator with a Qt user
interface, lots of video effects, and support for compressed ROMs.

The executable and man page are called punes (lowercase), not puNES.

Optional dependencies: nvidia-cg-toolkit and qt6. Neither is essential
for a full emulation experience.

nvidia-cg-toolkit is autodetected. It's required if you want to
use "*.cgp" shaders, such as the ones designed for libretro,
from https://github.com/libretro/common-shaders. If you have
nvidia-cg-toolkit installed, you can build puNES without it by
exporting CG=no in the environment.

qt6 is NOT autodetected. If you want to build with qt6, install it
first, then export QT6=yes in the environment. Warning: until qt6 is
included in a stable Slackware release, qt6 builds of puNES will not
be thoroughly tested by the SlackBuild maintainer. If it doesn't work
after a qt6 update, let me know (or, preferably, send me a patch that
fixes it).
