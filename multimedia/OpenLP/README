OpenLP stands for "Open Lyrics Projection" and is presentation
software developed for churches to provide a single easy to use
interface for the projection needs of a typical worship service.

First created in 2004, it has steadily grown in features and maturity
such that it is now a mainstay in hundreds of churches around the
world.

OpenLP has searchable databases of songs and Bible verses allowing
them to be projected instantly or saved in a pre-prepared order
of service file. Themes allow for a variety of presentation
options and allow you to add attractive visuals to enhance your
presentations. PowerPoint and OpenOffice presentations, videos and
audio files can be run from within the program removing the need to
switch between different programs. Alert messages can be displayed so
the nursery or car park stewards can notify the congregation easily.
Remote capability allows the worship leader to change songs, or for
alert messages to be sent from anywhere on the network, even via smart
phone/tablet.
