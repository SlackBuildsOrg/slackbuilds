DBGL serves as a frontend / Graphical User Interface to DOSBox
(configuration). It tries to make creating DOSBox configuration files
a little easier by offering a (relatively) simple interface, some
shortcuts and a little bit of intelligence (DOSBox behavior).
Once your DOS games are configured in DBGL, it's very easy to setup or
start them, or alter their configuration or associated DOSBox version.

Notes:
1. this works with both 'dosbox' and 'dosbox-dev' packages available at
   SBo, at least one of them must be installed.
2. this legacy version is the last one that supports 32-bits
   architecture, if you don't need that you may install package 'dbgl'
   instead

This packages builds only with zulu-openjdk8, maybe openjdk8.
It runs with zulu-openjdk7, but not zulu-openjdk11 or zulu-openjdk17.
