DOSbox is a DOS emulator/virtual machine for X11 and Unix.
It allows you to play many of the old games you grew up loving,
as well as many apps designed to run on DOS.

SDL_sound is an optional dependency.

This is the latest-or-almost development version, hence it is not
labeled stable by upstream.

dosbox-dev does conflict with the stable dosbox 0.74 Slackbuild, and
isn't meant to be used alongside.

If you want to have both dosbox and dosbox-dev packages installed set
DOSBOXDEV=yes, and man page, icon, desktop entry and dosbox binary
will be renamed dosbox-dev.

If you want to use another revision of the SVN codebase, see
README.SBo.
