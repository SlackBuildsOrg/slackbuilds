ROXTerm is a terminal emulator that uses the same VTE library as
gnome-terminal. Originally aimed at being a lightweight gtk terminal,
it has since grown in features and is now quite comparable to the
default GNOME/Xfce/Mate terminals. It is still a favorite among
"power" users due to its high configurability. The name comes from
the ROX desktop, although ROXTerm can be used anywhere.
