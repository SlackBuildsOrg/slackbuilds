# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

nwg-readme-browser: nwg-readme-browser (WebKitGTK-based README file browser)
nwg-readme-browser:
nwg-readme-browser: Nwg-readme-browser was conceived as rtfm with a graphical user
nwg-readme-browser: interface. It searches the /usr/share/doc path for README.* files,
nwg-readme-browser: and displays them in WebKit2.WebView. It supports .md, .rst, .html
nwg-readme-browser: and plain text. It does not support .pdf format. Although the
nwg-readme-browser: program was written with nwg-shell for sway and Hyprland in mind,
nwg-readme-browser: it may also be used standalone.
