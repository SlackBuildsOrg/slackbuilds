FinalBurn Neo (also referred to as FBNeo or FBN) is a multi-system 
emulator (Arcade, consoles and computers) under active development. 
Unlike MAME it's more focused on playability and advanced features 
than preservation. It is the follow-up of the FinalBurn and 
FinalBurn Alpha emulators. 

The libretro core provides wide compatibility with platforms and 
features supported by libretro.

To build the debugging symbols use:
