SpatiaLite is an open source library intended to extend the SQLite
core to support fully fledged Spatial SQL capabilities. SpatiaLite
is smoothly integrated into SQLite to provide a complete and powerful
Spatial DBMS (mostly OGC-SFS compliant). Using SQLite + SpatiaLite you
can effectively deploy an alternative open source Spatial DBMS roughly
equivalent to PostgreSQL + PostGIS.

liblwgeom (postgis) is optional but strongly recommended
dependency. To build spatialite with liblwgeom support set LWGEOM=yes.
