LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.

xblas is an optional dependency.

To build a static library in addition to the shared library,
pass STATIC=yes to the script.

Note: If you want good performance, then use the BLAS libraries
provided by your CPU vendor, or OpenBLAS or atlas provided by
SlackBuilds.org.
