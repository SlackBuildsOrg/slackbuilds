iselect (curses-based interactive selection tool)

OSSP iselect is an interactive line selection tool for textual files,
operating via a full-screen Curses-based terminal session. It can be
used either as an user interface frontend controlled by a scripting
backend as its wrapper or in batch mode as a pipeline filter (usually
between grep and the final executing command).

The package also includes screen-ir, a script to interactively
reattach to one of several screen sessions.
