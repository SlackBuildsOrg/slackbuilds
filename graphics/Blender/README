Blender is an integrated suite of free and open source tools enabling
the creation of a broad range of 3D content with the singular
benefits of cross-platform interoperability. It can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and cinema quality
video. It features fully integrated creation suite, offering a broad
range of essential tools for the creation of 3D content, including
modeling, uv-mapping, texturing, particle and other simulation,
scripting, rendering, compositing, post-production and game creation.


This SlackBuild builds Blender from source code using prepackaged
support libraries which don't provide libraries for i*86,
therefore 32bit builds are no longer supported.

The prepackaged libraries can themselves be built from source code if
desired and provided sufficient resources (disk space, cpu, time) are
available. See the README.libs file.

If targeting hardware rendering with Nvidia GPU, it is necessary to
first install the cudatoolkit_12 package, in which case additional
dedicated rendering binaries will be generated during the Blender
build. In this case, it is also recommended to install the
OptiX-Headers SlackBuild; this enables optix render kernels to be
built into Blender.

For a comparison of bare CUDA and OptiX (which requires CUDA anyway)
see:
    https://yelzkizi.org/optix-vs-cuda/

If targeting hardware rendering with AMD GPU, it is necessary to
first install the rocmtoolkit_6 package, in which case additional
dedicated rendering binaries will be generated during the Blender
build.

After installing the built package, log out and back in again to
initiate the ability to launch from the desktop menu
(at Graphics/Blender).

See also: graphics/blender (note, lowercase b), which repackages the
official Blender x86_64 release binary.
