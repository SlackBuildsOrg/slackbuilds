Leafpad (a notepad clone for GTK+ 2.0)

Leafpad is a simple GTK+ text editor that emphasizes simplicity. As
development focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most
essential features are implemented in the editor. Leafpad is simple to
use, is easily compiled, requires few libraries, and starts up quickly.

Atril or Evince are optional dependencies for print preview.
