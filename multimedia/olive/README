Olive is a cross-platform video editing application licensed under
the GNU GPL version 3. The plan of the development team is to combine
complete colour managment, a fast and high-fidelity float-based
render pipeline, node-based compositing and audio-mixing, and a
highly efficient automated disk cache all together in one program.

It should be noted that Olive is still in the early alpha stages of
development, and thus should not be used for serious projects; if you
do choose to use Olive for any serious projects, frequent backups of
said projects are highly recommended.

This SlackBuild packages an older version of Olive (0.1.2), which is
the latest stable version as of this writing.

The patches in this SlackBuild were originally written by TÃ©rcio
Martins for Arch's Olive AUR, and have been graciously re-used here
with his permission.
