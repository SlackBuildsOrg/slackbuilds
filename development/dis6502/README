dis6502 (flow-tracing disassembler for 6502)

dis6502 is a 6502 disassembler that supports Atari 8-bit and Commodore
executables, as well as raw memory dumps. It attempts to separate code
sections from data by tracing the flow of execution, and supports a
config file for manually defining code sections that aren't reached by
the trace.

Note: the package includes predef files for Atari and Commodore 8-bit
computers, for use with the -p option, in /usr/share/dis6502.

Note: This is NOT the dis6502 from AtariMax. Although the name is the
same, AtariMax's disassembler is completely different (for one thing,
it's a Windows GUI application).
