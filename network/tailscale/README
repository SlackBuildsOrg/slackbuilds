Tailscale is a zero config VPN for building secure networks.
Install on any device in minutes. Remote access from any
network or physical location.

The service has two parts: tailscaled (daemon) and tailscale.
Both must run. I use this from a terminal:

daemon --user root tailscaled $exec && tailscale up

The first time, a url will pop up to authenticate.
