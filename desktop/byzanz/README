Byzanz is a simple tool to record a running X desktop to an animation
suitable for presentation in a web browser. It's design has been
guided by the following principles:

- PURPOSE Byzanz records animations for presentation in a web browser.
  If something doesn't fit this goal, it should not be part of Byzanz.

- CORRECTNESS When Byzanz provides a feature, it does this correctly.
  In particular, it does not crash or corrupt data.

- SIMPLICITY The user interface and programming code are simple and
  easy to understand and don't contain any unecessary features. Byzanz
  does not attempt to do be smarter than you are.

- UNOBTRUSIVENESS Byzanz does not interfere with the task you are
  recording, neither by keeping a large settings window around nor by
  consuming all your CPU during a recording.

Byzanz is implemented as a GNOME applet. A command line tool for
testing purposes is available, too.
