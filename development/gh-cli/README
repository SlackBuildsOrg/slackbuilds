gh-cli is the GitHub command line interface.

It provides access to GitHub features directly from the terminal,
including repository management, issues, pull requests, releases,
and GitHub Actions workflows.

This SlackBuild builds gh-cli from source using the upstream Makefile
and the system Go compiler.
