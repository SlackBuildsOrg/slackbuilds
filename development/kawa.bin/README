Kawa is a general-purpose programming language that runs on the Java
platform. It aims to combine:

    the benefits of dynamic scripting languages (non-verbose code with
    less boiler-plate, fast and easy start-up, a REPL, no required
    compilation step); with

    the benefits of traditional compiled languages (fast execution,
    static error detection, modularity, zero-overhead Java platform
    integration).

This build repackages the "binary", java-compiled version.
