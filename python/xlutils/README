A Python package provides a collection of utilities for working with
Excel files. Since these utilities may require either or both of the
xlrd and xlwt packages, they are collected together here, separate
from either package.

Currently available are:

xlutils.copy
    Tools for copying xlrd.Book objects to xlwt.Workbook objects.
xlutils.display
  Utility functions for displaying information about xlrd-related
  objects in a user-friendly and safe fashion.
xlutils.filter
  A mini framework for splitting and filtering Excel files into new
  Excel files.
xlutils.margins
  Tools for finding how much of an Excel file contains useful data.
xlutils.save
  Tools for serializing xlrd.Book objects back to Excel files.
xlutils.styles
  Tools for working with formatting information expressed in styles.
