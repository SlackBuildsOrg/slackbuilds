graphite-carbon (Backend caching/persistence daemon for Graphite)

Graphite is a web application using the Twisted framework to provide
real-time visualization and storage of numeric time-series data.
The Carbon daemon processes the incoming time-series data and saves it
as Whisper database files.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
