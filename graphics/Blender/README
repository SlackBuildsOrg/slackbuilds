Blender is an integrated suite of free and open source tools enabling
the creation of a broad range of 3D content with the singular
benefits of cross-platform interoperability. It can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and cinema quality
video. It features fully integrated creation suite, offering a broad
range of essential tools for the creation of 3D content, including
modeling, uv-mapping, texturing, particle and other simulation,
scripting, rendering, compositing, post-production and game creation.

This SlackBuild builds Blender from source code using prepackaged
official support libraries from blender.org

After installing the built package, log out and back in again to
enable launching from the desktop menu (at Graphics/Blender).

See also: graphics/blender (note, lowercase b), which repackages the
official Blender x86_64 release binary.
