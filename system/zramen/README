Zramen is a simple bash script that makes managing zram much easier.
This SlackBuild provides the zramen script but also a service script
compatible with sysvinit.

To enable zramen on startup, add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zramen ]; then
  	# Start Zramen
  	/etc/rc.d/rc.zramen start
	fi
