Tahoe, the Least-Authority File Store.

Tahoe-LAFS is a secure, decentralized, file store. All of the source
code is available under a choice of two Free Software, Open Source
licences.

The file store is encrypted and spread over multiple peers in such a way
that it remains available even when some of the peers are unavailable,
malfunctioning, or malicious.

Tahoe-LAFS now features native Tor and I2P support.

Optional Dependency

In case you'd like proper documentation to be build Sphinx needs to be
installed at build time.
