The libmusicbrainz (also known as mb_client or MusicBrainz Client
Library) is a development library geared towards developers who wish
to add MusicBrainz lookup capabilities to their applications.

cppunit is an optional build-time dependency.

Note: This is a new library for libmusicbrainz, which is not backwards
compatible with previous versions. It is safe to have version 2.X and
version 3.X on the same system as they don't conflict with each other.
