krop is a simple graphical tool to crop the pages of PDF files.

It is written in Python and relies on python-poppler-qt5 or
python3-PyMuPDF for rendering, and pypdf/python3-PyPDF2 or pikepdf or
python3-PyMuPDF for cropping. It features automatic margin cropping.

Krop can automatically split pages into subpages to fit the limited
screen size of devices such as eReaders. This is particularly useful, if
your eReader does not support convenient scrolling.

This script has no build dependencies.

Two runtime dependencies to be choosen from the following options:
* python-poppler-qt5 or python3-PyMuPDF
* pypdf (version > 3) or python3-PyPDF2 or pikepdf or python3-PyMuPDF
They are autodetected or set manually using options.
