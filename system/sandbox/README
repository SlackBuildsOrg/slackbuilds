sandbox (Gentoo Sandbox Tool)

Sandbox is a library (and helper utility) to run programs in a
"sandboxed" environment. This is used as a QA measure to try and
prevent applications from modifying files they should not.

For example, in the Gentoo world they use it so they can build
applications as root and make sure that the build system does not do
crazy things outside of its build directory. Such as install files to
the live root file system or modify config files on the fly.

For people who are familiar with the Debian "fakeroot" project or the
RPM based "InstallWatch", sandbox is in the same vein of projects.
