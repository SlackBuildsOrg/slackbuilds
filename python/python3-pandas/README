The Python Data Analysis Library (Pandas) is an open source,
BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data
structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming
language.

NOTE: Unable to support newer versions than 2.1.4 due to requiring a
newer Cython than included in Slackware (needs 3.0.5).
