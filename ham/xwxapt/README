xwxapt is a GTK+ graphical version of wxapt. It uses the same decoding
engine as wxapt but it displays APT images at half-size as they are
received, storing the full-sized files when reception is completed.
It also displays some status information (audio level, sync level,
sync status etc) and text messages as it runs.

By default, xwxapt wants to create a directory in the home directory
of the installing user. The SlackBuild disables that, but the directory
structure including config file has been made available in
/usr/share/xwxapt-$VERSION

A config file has been added in
/usr/share/xwxapt-$VERSION/xwxapt/xwxaptrc which you will need to copy
and modify before starting xwxapt for the first time.
