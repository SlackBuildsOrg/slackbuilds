This directory is a local OVERLAY of system/qemu.

The SlackBuild is kept here to allow local customization and testing.
In practice, only x86_64 targets are usually needed, so builds are
invoked with explicit TARGETS instead of building all architectures.

Build commands used:

Slackware-current:
  AUDIODRIVERS=pipewire \
  KVMGROUP=kvm \
  BRIDGE_HELPER_SETUID=yes \
  TARGETS="x86_64-softmmu,x86_64-linux-user,i386-softmmu,i386-linux-user" \
  ./qemu.SlackBuild

Slackware 15.0:
  BRIDGE_HELPER_SETUID=yes \
  TARGETS="x86_64-softmmu,x86_64-linux-user,i386-softmmu,i386-linux-user" \
  ./qemu.SlackBuild

Changes in this directory are local-only and not intended for upstream
submission.
