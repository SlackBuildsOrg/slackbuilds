CUnit is a lightweight system for writing, administering, and
running unit tests in C. It provides C programmers a basic testing
functionality with a flexible variety of user interfaces.

CUnit is built as a static library which is linked with the user's
testing code. It uses a simple framework for building test structures,
and provides a rich set of assertions for testing common data types. In
addition, several different interfaces are provided for running tests
and reporting results.
