kitscenarist (screenplay authoring tool)

Create screen & stage plays, audio dramas, comics, and novels.
Streamlined workflow with multiple episodes within single project.
Advanced character profile, relations plot, map of locations, AI
assistant, poster generator, and other features.

Note: kitscenarist is no longer developed. The last release was
in 2022, and the last git activity was in 2024. However, it remains
useful software, so it will continue to be provided on SlackBuilds.org
so long as that remains practical.
