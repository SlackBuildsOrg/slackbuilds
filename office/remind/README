Remind - sophisticated command-line calendar and alarm program by
Dianne Skoll

Features timed reminders and pop-up alarms, facilities for both the
Gregorian and Hebrew calendars and support for 12 different language.

There are several options that may be passed to the script using
`VAR=value ./remind.SlackBuild`. If not passed, they assume a default
value. They are:

LATITUDE (decimal degrees, positive North;
         default: 45.42055555555555)
LONGITUDE (decimal degrees, positive West;
         default: -75.68944444444445
LOCATION (string; default: Ottawa)

Default location and coordinates are Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.  NB
LOCATION is just a string identifier. You can set it to anything you
want. There is no coordinate lookup - you must also enter LATITUDE and
LONGITUDE or accept the default values. There is nothing to stop you
from entering the coordinates for Nome, Alaska, and calling it "Havana,
Cuba"

PAGE (string, default: Letter) set the default page size for
      rem2ps. Can be one of: Letter, Tabloid, Ledger, Legal,
      Statement, Executive, A3, A4, A5, B4, B5, Folio, Quarto,
      10x14. Custom page sizes can be set at run time with the -m
      option.
      
DATESEP (character, default: '-') date separator character
TIMESEP (character, default: ':') time separator character
DATETIMESEP (character, default: '@' ) datetime separator character

Some of these options can be changed at run time through SET commands.

Default language is English. Other languages can be set at run time by
placing something like this at the top of your reminders file:

SYSINCLUDE lang/de.rem

Other language packs include da.rem (Danish), de.rem (German), es.rem
(Spanish), fr.rem (French), is.rem (Icelandic), it.rem (Italian),
nl.rem (Dutch), no.rem (Norwegian), pl.rem (Polish), pt.rem
(Portuguese) and ro.rem (Romanian).
