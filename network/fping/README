fping (send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts)

fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar
to ping, but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts.

NOTE: Old fping and fping6 packages are no longer needed, and should
probably be removed before installing this one.
