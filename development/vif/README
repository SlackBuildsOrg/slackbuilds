vif (vintage fortran compiler)

VIF is an 'early FORTRAN' dialect, encompassing a large subset
of FORTRAN II/IV and FORTRAN 66/77. VIF is a front end using a gcc
compatible C99 compiler as back end. VIF uses gcc extensions to C, and
also gcc's libquadmath.

If you want to run the compiler's self-test suite, do this:

1. Run vif.SlackBuild with no option, install the resulting package.
2. Run vif.SlackBuild a second time, with CHECK=yes in the environment.
3. Install the newly-built package. The results of 'make check' will
   be in /usr/doc/vif-$VERSION/make_check.log

This is required because the self-test only knows how to test the
installed vif on the system.
