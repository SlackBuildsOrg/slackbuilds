HandBrake is an open-source tool, built by volunteers, for converting
video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported
codecs.

HandBrake takes videos you already have and makes new ones that work on
your mobile phone, tablet, TV media player, game console, computer, or
web browserâ€”nearly anything that supports modern video formats.

HandBrake works with most common video files and formats, including
ones created by consumer and professional video cameras, mobile devices
such as phones and tablets, game and computer screen recordings, and DVD
and Blu-ray discs. HandBrake leverages tools such as FFmpeg, x264, and
x265 to create new MP4 or MKV video files from these Sources.

HandBrake does not support linking to most system libraries for many of
its dependencies due to the large number of patches it utlizes for those
projects, so it will compile and statically link those during the build.

To skip building the GTK GUI, pass GUI=no to the script:

    # GUI=no sh ./HandBrake.SlackBuild

Commands
--------

* GUI: `ghb`
* CLI: `HandBrakeCLI`
