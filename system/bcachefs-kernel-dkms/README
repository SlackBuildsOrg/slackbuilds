This package provides the bcachefs kernel module source for building
via DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support), or the kernel module can 
optionally be built by the package itself without DKMS.

This package contains the kernel module dkms source code that can be
installed to /usr/src/ where it can be managed by DKMS. Users can
then build and install the module for their target kernel using
standard DKMS commands.

KERNEL REQUIREMENTS:
This package requires a custom kernel with minimum version 6.16. 

Kernel headers >= 6.16 must be installed also.  These are not
available for Slackware 15.0 by default - you can use the 
kernel-headers.SlackBuild script from Slackware source to generate
them.

The target kernel must be configured with one of the following:

1) CONFIG_BCACHEFS_FS=m (bcachefs built as module) - RECOMMENDED
   This is the safest approach as all dependencies are handled
   automatically by the kernel configuration system.  DKMS can then
   replace the old module with the latest version.

2) If CONFIG_BCACHEFS_FS=n (bcachefs disabled), the kernel must include
   all of bcachefs's dependencies. For example CONFIG_CRC64,
   CONFIG_CRYPTO_CHACHA20, CONFIG_LZ4_COMPRESS and so forth.  
 
OPTIONAL KERNEL MODULE BUILD:
This SlackBuild can also create pre-compiled kernel modules instead
of installing DKMS source. To build kernel modules for your installed
kernel, set MAKE_KMOD as follows:

MAKE_KMOD=yes ./bcachefs-kernel-dkms.SlackBuild

This creates a bcachefs-kernel-module package with compiled .ko files
that can be installed immediately without using/requiring DKMS tools.
