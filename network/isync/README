isync is a command line application which synchronizes mailboxes;
currently Maildir and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported. New messages,
message deletions and flag changes can be propagated both ways. isync
is suitable for use in IMAP-disconnected mode.

Synchronization is based on unique message identifiers (UIDs), so
no identification conflicts can occur (as opposed to some other mail
synchronizers). Synchronization state is kept in one local text file
per mailbox pair; multiple replicas of a mailbox can be maintained.

See README.SLACKWARE for setup information after installation.
