Seahub is the web frontend for Seafile.

Note: This isn't the official "source" tarball, but `seahub' extracted
from the binary tarball, due to its very weird, and old dependencies.

Due to the nature of Slackware pkgtools no seafile data from the users
is removed, but just in case, create a backup before upgrading this
package!

This package does not update/upgrade Seafile internal stuff.
Refer to the Seafile manual:

  http://manual.seafile.com/deploy/upgrade.html

Stop your instance before upgrading this package and don't use
the shell scripts from the documentation, but use `seafile` from
/usr/sbin to start/stop Seafile.
