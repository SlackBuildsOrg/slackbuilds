OptiX is an application framework for achieving optimal ray tracing
performance on the GPU.

This repository contains the minimal set of necessary header files for
building an application with OptiX support, including access to the
OptiX functions provided by the NVIDIA display driver.

Usage of this API allows for an application to offload its ray tracing
calculations to the system's onboard NVIDIA GPU card, potentially
drastically reducing render speeds.

This SlackBuild targets SBo's graphics/Blender SlackBuild which will
automatically detect the OptiX headers and build Blender to include
OptiX rendering kernels as well as GPU-accelerated image denoising.

The built OptiX-Headers package requires a recent CUDA toolkit to
be useful when building Blender but the CUDA toolkit is not required
to build OptiX-Headers itself.
