wxWidgets is a cross-platform API for writing GUI applications
on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's
controls and utilities.

webkit2gtk is an optional dependency of this package. This will
provide webview support.

nanosvg is another optional dependency. By default, the
SlackBuild script checks for the nanosvg system headers and
disables SVG support if they are not found; you can force
different behavior (e.g. using wxWidgets' internal copy of
nanosvg, or always disabling SVG support) with the "NANOSVG"
environment variable (see wxWidgets.SlackBuild for details).

Notes:

1. This package is NOT built using --enable-stl by default.
   If you need to enable stl, use:
   STL=yes ./wxWidgets.SlackBuild

2. If you need the wxWidgets API documentation, you need to
   install graphviz, then run wxWidgets.SlackBuild with
   APIDOC=yes in the environment. You won't need the API docs
   unless you're developing software.

This package provides 2 interfaces, GTK3 and Qt5.
By default, wx-config will be linked to GTK3, but if you want
to use Qt5, use INTERFACE=qt variable to override.
