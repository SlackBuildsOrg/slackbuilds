# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pdm: python3-pdm (Python manager supporting the latest PEP standards)
python3-pdm:
python3-pdm: PDM is meant to be a next generation Python package management
python3-pdm: tool. It was originally built for personal use. If you feel you
python3-pdm: are going well with Pipenv or Poetry and don't want to introduce
python3-pdm: another package manager, just stick to it. But if you are missing
python3-pdm: something that is not present in those tools, you can probably find
python3-pdm: some goodness in pdm.
