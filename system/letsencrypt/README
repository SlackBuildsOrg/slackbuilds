The Let's Encrypt Client (now called certbot) is a tool to
automatically receive and install X.509 certificates to enable TLS on
servers.  The client will interoperate with the Let's Encrypt CA which
will be issuing browser-trusted certificates for free.

See README.Slackware for more detailed instructions.

Note: the certificate client tool is now certbot, but a symlink is
provided to be backward compatible with previous letsencrypt version.
Please rename the script to the new name: certbot

Since 1.1.0, most of deps must be (re)built against Python3.
