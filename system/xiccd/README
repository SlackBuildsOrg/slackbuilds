xiccd

xiccd is a simple bridge between colord and X. It does the following
tasks:

 * Enumerates displays and register them in colord;
 * Creates default ICC profiles based on EDID data;
 * Applies ICC profiles provided by colord;
 * Maintains user's private ICC storage directory.

It does basically the same as gnome-settings-daemon color plugin or
colord-kde but does not depend on any particular desktop. It even
doesn't depend on GTK so it doesn't create useless GTK3 dependency if
the desktop environment is GTK2-based or vice versa. The primary goal of
xiccd is providing color profile support for desktop environments other
than Gnome and KDE (Xfce, LXDE and probably others) that do not support
native color management yet. It is however not meant to be excuse of not
adding native color management to the session daemons of them.
