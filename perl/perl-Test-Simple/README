This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing tests
suitable for CPAN modules and other pursuits. If you wish to do more
complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement
for this one).

The basic unit of Perl testing is the ok. For each thing you want to
test your program will print out an "ok" or "not ok" to indicate pass
or fail.
