GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. The
library includes support for the SASL framework (with authentication
functions and application data privacy and integrity functions) and at
least partial support for the CRAM-MD5, EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, ANONYMOUS,
PLAIN, SECURID, DIGEST-MD5, LOGIN, NTLM and KERBEROS_V5 mechanisms.
