TSDuck is an extensible toolkit for MPEG transport streams.
It is used in digital television systems
for test, monitoring, integration, debug, lab, demo.

In practice, TSDuck can be used for:
- Transport stream acquisition or transmodulation, including
  DVB, ATSC, ISDB, ASI and IP multicast.
- Analyze transport streams, PSI/SI signalization, bitrates,
  timestamps.
- Monitor and report conditions on the stream (video and audio
  properties, bitrates, crypto-periods, signalization).
- On-the-fly transformation or injection of content and signalization.
- Modify, remove, rename, extract services.
- Work on live transport streams, DVB-S/C/T, ATSC, ISDB-S/T, ASI,
  IP-TV, HTTP, HLS, SRT, RIST or offline transport stream files.
- Receive from or send to specialized hardware such as:
  路 Cheap DVB, ATSC or ISDB tuners (USB, PCI).
  路 Professional Dektec devices, ASI, modulators (USB, PCI).
  路HiDes modulators (USB).
  路 VATek-based modulators (USB) such as the Suntechtv U3.
- Re-route transport streams to other applications.
- Extract or inject Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) between TS and
  UDP/IP.
- Analyze and inject SCTE 35 splice information.
- Extract specific encapsulated data (Teletext, T2-MI).
- Emulate a CAS head-end using DVB SimulCrypt interfaces to and from
  ECMG or EMMG.
- And more...
