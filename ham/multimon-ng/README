The successor to multimon, with support for more modes and improved
compatibility with moderns systems. It decodes the following digital
transmission modes commonly found on VHF/UHF bands:

  POCSAG512 POCSAG1200 POCSAG2400
  FLEX
  EAS
  UFSK1200 CLIPFSK AFSK1200 AFSK2400 AFSK2400_2 AFSK2400_3
  HAPN4800
  FSK9600
  DTMF
  ZVEI1 ZVEI2 ZVEI3 DZVEI PZVEI
  EEA EIA CCIR
  MORSE CW
  X10

Multiple decoders can run concurrently on the same signal, which
is provided via a file or a pipe. Common setups are: a radio
connected via a sound card (may require modifications to the radio);
samples provided via a GNU Radio sink or the UDP audio stream in
gqrx (via netcat and sox).
