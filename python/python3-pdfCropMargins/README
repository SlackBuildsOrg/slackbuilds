The pdfCropMargins program is a command-line application to
automatically crop the margins of PDF files. Cropping the margins can
make it easier to read the pages of a PDF document - whether the
document is printed or displayed on a screen - because the display fonts
are larger. This program is similar to the Perl script pdfcrop except
with many more options.
