commercial products such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, which includes many
Java EE, Web development and deployment-related features that are not
available in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. JetBrains also builds
different specific products such as RubyMine, WebStorm, PhpStorm,
PyCharm, AppCode and MPS, which serve the needs of different developer

IntelliJ Platform.
