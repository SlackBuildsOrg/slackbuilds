python3-trakit (Guess additional info from titles in media tracks)

TrakIt is a track name parser. It is a tiny library created to
solve a very specific problem. It's very common that video files do
not have precise metadata information, where you can have multiple
subtitle tracks tagged as Portuguese, but one of them is actually
Brazilian Portuguese. Or you have multiple audio tracks in English,
but one of them is British English (British English Forced (PGS))
and others are American English (American English (PGS)).
