The CLI version is built by default and the GUI version will be built
automatically if wxGTK3 is installed. Either can be manually disabled
by passing GUI=no or CLI=no to the SlackBuild script, but at least one
must be enabled to build the program.

wxGTK3 is an optional, autodetected dependency required for the GUI.
