iwd (iNet Wireless Daemon)

iNet Wireless Daemon (iwd) project aims to provide a comprehensive
Wi-Fi connectivity solution for Linux based devices. The core goal of
the project is to optimize resource utilization: storage, runtime
memory and link-time costs. This is accomplished by not depending on
any external libraries and utilizes features provided by the Linux
kernel to the maximum extent possible. The result is a self-contained
environment that only depends on the Linux kernel and the runtime C
library.

To run iwd on startup, run (as root):
  chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd
then add this to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.iwd start
  fi

Before running iwd, remove all configuration in /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf
and ensure no other connection daemon is running.
e.g. run `netconfig' and choose "loopback"

iwd's command-line client is started as `iwctl'
An example session:

  $ iwctl
  [iwd]# station wlan0 scan
  [iwd]# station wlan0 get-networks
  ...
  [iwd]# station wlan0 connect <your-network>
  [iwd]# exit


(iwd can also be used as a backend for NetworkManager but this is
considered experimental)
