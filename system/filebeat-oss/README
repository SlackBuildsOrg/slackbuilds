filebeat-oss (Lightweight shipper for logs)

Whether youâ€™re collecting from security devices, cloud, containers,
hosts, or OT, Filebeat helps you keep the simple things simple by
offering a lightweight way to forward and centralize logs and files.

Filebeat is a lightweight shipper for forwarding and centralizing
log data. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors
the log files or locations that you specify, collects log events,
and forwards them either to Elasticsearch or Logstash for indexing.

If you intend to use filebeat with elasticsearch:
Add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.filebeat ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.filebeat start
fi

Add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.filebeat ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.filebeat stop
fi

The previous instruction is not necessary if you are going to
use the filebeat with graylog , the graylog is what starts the
filebeat.
