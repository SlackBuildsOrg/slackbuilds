Perl parser for the Kindle's 3 and 4 "My Clippings.txt" file

The myclippings script is based on parse_kindle_clippings script and
parses Kindle's "My Clippings.txt" file for highlights, notes, and
bookmarks, groups them by book/title, and stores them in the separate
files or in a single file.

Kindle's "My Clippings.txt" file is a mess. The myclippings script
helps to sort clippings in order to process them in the editor or to
store sorted and edited clippings back in "My Clippings.txt" file.
