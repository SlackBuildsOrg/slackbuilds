tinyproxy (lightweight HTTP proxy)

tinyproxy is a lightweight HTTP proxy licensed under the GPL.
Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet small, it is an ideal
solution for sites where a full-featured HTTP proxy is required,
but the system resources required to run a more demanding HTTP proxy
are unavailable. tinyproxy is fully compatible with all existing web
browsers
