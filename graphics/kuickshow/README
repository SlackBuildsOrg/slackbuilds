KuickShow displays images using all the available space, without being
wasted in bars or menus. It also has a smart automatic zooming that
scales images according to its size. You can use the integrated file
browser to choose images, or navigate through a folder with the
mousewheel or the keyboard. It also has fullscreen view and slideshow,
and supports a wide range of image formats.
    Optional dependencies are imlib, imlib2, though KuickShow is best
with them, so they're included in 'REQUIRES' for easier automated build.
