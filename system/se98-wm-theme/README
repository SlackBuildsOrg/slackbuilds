se98-wm-theme

A theme designed to imitate Windows 98 SE.

It is not complete, not not expect too much from it.

It is designed to be used together with se98-icon-theme, and
maybe something else (not yet implemented).

It is also worth checking the howto for Redmond97

https://github.com/nestoris/se98-wm-theme

It installs themes for:

gtk-2.0
gtk-3.0
metacity-1
xfwm4

I think, newer GNOME and Wayland DEs are not supported, so
your help is appreciated.
It also does not seem to support Adwaita/libadwaita, or
somethng like that.
