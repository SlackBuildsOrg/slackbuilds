SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library that allows
changing the sound tempo, pitch, and playback rate parameters
independently from each other. For example:

- tempo can be increased/decreased while maintaining the original pitch
- pitch can be increased/decreased while maintaining the original tempo
- Change playback rate, affects both tempo and pitch at the same time
- Choose any combination of tempo/pitch/rate
