TeamViewer is a remote control application. TeamViewer provides easy,
fast and secure remote access to Linux, Windows PCs, and Macs.

You must give execute permission on /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd and run
/etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd start prior launching TeamViewer application

To make this process repeated on every boot sequence, add this line 
in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd start
fi

NOTE:
1. Newer version of Teamviewer can establish remote control connections
to older version (version 3 and above), but not in the opposite direction.
The same things goes to meetings (version 7 and above).

2. Always stop teamviewerd service and remove the old version before
attempting to upgrade as the path and configs may change on each major release.

3. Starting from Teamviewer 13, it has come up with native 64 client package, so
no multilib is required to use. It uses Qt as a foundation.
