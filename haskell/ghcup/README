GHCup makes it easy to install specific versions of GHC on GNU/Linux,
macOS (aka Darwin), FreeBSD and Windows and can also bootstrap a fresh
Haskell developer environment from scratch. It follows the UNIX
philosophy of do one thing and do it well. Similar in scope to rustup,
pyenv and jenv.

This is a binary repack.
