# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive (Perl module)
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive:
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: Sub::Exporter is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: comes great responsibility, as well as some runtime penalties.
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: This module is a Sub::Exporter wrapper that will let your users just
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: use Exporter if all they are doing is picking exports, but use
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: Sub::Exporter if your users try to use Sub::Exporter's more advanced
perl-Sub-Exporter-Progressive: features, like renaming exports, if they try to use them.
