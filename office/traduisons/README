Traduisons! (French for "Let's Translate!") is a front-end for google
translate, allowing translation of words and sentences without opening
the browser. It is written in python and optionally uses a gtk-based
gui.

Traduisons! is focused on being as streamlined and fast as
possible. It is designed to be a quick, reference tool, not a
large-scale document translator.

Traduisons! itself is not a translator. It works by sending a query
string to Google's web-based translation service and copying the
result to the clipboard and screen.

All operations are performed with keyboard shortcuts or specific input
characters such as '`/`' and '`.`'.

Internet access is required to use Traduisons!
