# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right marks the last column you can use.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's okay to leave
# a line blank.
