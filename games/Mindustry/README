Mindustry is a hybrid tower-defense sandbox factory game.
Create elaborate supply chains of conveyor belts to feed ammo into
your turrets, produce materials to use for building, and defend your
structures from waves of enemies.

Features include a map editor, 24 built-in maps, cross-platform
multiplayer and large-scale PvP unit battles.

Java 17 minimum is required to build.
This does *not* build offline.
