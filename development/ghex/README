ghex (hex editor with GTK4 GUI)

GHex allows the user to load data from any file, view and edit it in
either hex or ASCII. Useful for debugging problems with object code
or encodings. Also used by kids who cheat at computer games, by adding
score or lives to saved games.

Optional dependency: yelp. Enable by setting the SlackBuild option
YELP=true if desired. This allows for the built-in help to be viewed
natively with the standard GNOME help tool.

If this option is not enabled, the build will enable static HTML help by
default, which will allow the built-in help to be viewed with other help
viewers, such as KDE's help viewer, or by manually navigating to
/usr/doc/HTML/{lang}/ghex, where "{lang}" is the applicable ISO language
code.

Buliding the libgtkhex API documentation requires `gi-docgen`, which is
not presently in the slackbuilds.org repositories at the of writing. If
you choose to install this manually and wish to build the API
documentation, you can set the SlackBuild option GTK_DOC=true
