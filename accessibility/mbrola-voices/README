MBROLA voices database

This project provides list of MBROLA speech synthesizer voices. It is
intended to provide easier collaboration and automatic updates for
individual users and packagers.

This package does not contain executable code, so does not _strictly_
depend on mbrola, but it is unlikely to be useful without it, and
mbrola itself is not likely to be useful without this package.

Mbrola voices are _not_ independent of espeak's own voices.
If you want to use an mbrola voice to add intonation to Espeak's voice,
add mb- before the voice name, and if it is supported, espeak will use
the intonation file.

To test that mbrola voices have been installed correctly, run:

/usr/bin/espeak -v mb-us2 -s 120 test
