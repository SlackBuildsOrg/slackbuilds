Incremental is a small library that versions your Python projects.

Beware, since 24.7 release, this packages interferes with some*
other builds, which were fine with stock setuptools.
You can either remove python3-incremental before building, or
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/python$PYVER/site-packages
with PYVER set to your python3 version.
