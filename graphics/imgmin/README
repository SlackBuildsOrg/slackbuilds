imgmin is a CLI app uses a lossless mechanism to generate the
optimized images by manipulating pixel blocks. imgmin offers an
automated means for enforcing image quality as a standalone tool
and as a webserver module. imgmin determines the optimal balance of
image quality and filesize, often greatly reducing image size while
retaining quality for casual use, which translates into more efficient
use of storage and network bandwidth, which saves money and improves
user experience.

The JPEG quality settings most used by graphics professionals tend
to be highly conservative because Compression and image quality are
inversely proportional and graphics people are interested in utmost
visual quality and not in spending time worrying about network
efficiency.

The result of overly conservative JPEG compression and webservers'
inability to compress them any further means that many images on the
web are too large. JPEG's overwhelming popularity as the most common
image format means that many pages contain dozens of JPEG images.

These bloated images take longer to transfer, leading to extended load
time, which does not produce a good viewer experience.
