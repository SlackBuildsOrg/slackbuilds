domino-chain (puzzle game)

Domino-Chain is a puzzle game where you have to rearrange dominoes on
different platforms to start a chain reaction that makes all dominoes
topple over. There are many strange types of dominoes, such as the
Ascender which will rise to the ceiling when pushed, or the Exploder
which will blast a hole into the platform it stands on.

Domino-Chain is a faithful reincarnation of the game Pushover
originally published by Ocean in 1992. Compared to Pushover,
Domino-Chain has some new levels, some additional domino types, better
graphics in higher resolution and high-quality music. On top of that,
you can load and play the original levels from Pushover if you have a
copy of it.

Domino-Chain used to actually be called Pushover, but its developers
changed the name sometime after the 0.0.3 release. This SlackBuild
replaces the old games/pushover build.

If the game flickers like mad and is unplayable, you may have to
use software rendering. Build with OPENGL=no in the environment. The
SlackBuild author's older NVidia card (with proprietary driver) has
this problem.
