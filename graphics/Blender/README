Blender is an integrated suite of free and open source tools enabling
the creation of a broad range of 3D content with the singular
benefits of cross-platform interoperability. It can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and cinema quality
video. It features fully integrated creation suite, offering a broad
range of essential tools for the creation of 3D content, including
modeling, uv-mapping, texturing, particle and other simulation,
scripting, rendering, compositing, post-production and game creation.

This SlackBuild builds Blender from source code using prepackaged
support libraries which don't provide libraries for i*86,
therefore 32bit builds are no longer supported.

The prepackaged libraries can themselves be built from source code.
See README.libs

When targeting Nvidia GPU, it is recommended to first install the
cudatoolkit_12 package, in which case additional dedicated rendering
binaries will be generated during the Blender build.

After installing the built package, log out and back in again to the
initiate ability to launch from the desktop menu (at Graphics/Blender).

See also: graphics/blender (note, lowercase b), which repackages the
official Blender x86_64 release binary.
