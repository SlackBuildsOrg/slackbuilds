Kuro is an unofficial, featureful, open source, community-driven, free
Microsoft To-Do app for Linux made by David Morais.

Kuro is a fork of Ao wich is no longer actively maintained.

Warning : changes

It is highly recommended you delete your ~/.kuro.jsonconfiguration file
in order to have the new keyboard shortcuts and the default theme.

Kuro 9 fundamentally changes the way one of Kuro's most important
feature works:

Recently, Microsoft finally released the dark theme implementation for
the web version of their ToDo app, they call it Night Mode.
Instead of coming pre-packed the 4 themes (Dark, Black, Dracula &
Sepia), Kuro will now use its repurposed Ctrl + H shortcut to toggle
between Microsoft ToDo's Night Mode.

And starting with Kuro 9, you'll be able to create and use your own
themes with Kuro !
