Roswell is a full-stack environment for Common Lisp development and
provides many features that make it easy to test, share and
distribute your Lisp applications.

Roswell is still in beta. Despite this, the basic interfaces are
stable and not likely to change.

Please note that you should run the following command as a chosen user
to build (compile, load and dump) the lisp-based part of roswell, using
the `ros` binary after installation. The result is the dumped lisp
image, which is saved in ~/.roswell:

  $ ros setup

You should also repeat this step after upgrading the package.
