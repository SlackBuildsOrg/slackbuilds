# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

neovim: Neovim is a fork of the venerable text-editor vim, focused on
neovim: extensibility and usability. It is not a rewrite but a continuation
neovim: and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very
neovim: clever-but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good
neovim: parts of Vim, and more.
