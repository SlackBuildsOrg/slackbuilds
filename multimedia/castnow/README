castnow is a command-line utility that can be used to play back media
files on your Chromecast device. It supports playback of local video
files, videos on the web and torrents.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
