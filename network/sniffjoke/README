An internet client running SniffJoke injects in the transmission flow
some packets able to seriously disturb passive analysis like sniffing,
interception and low level information theft. No server support needed!

Please read documentation files in /usr/doc/sniffjoke-$VERSION to set
sniffjoke up properly.
