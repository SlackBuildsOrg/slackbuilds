wifitui
=======

wifitui is a fast and friendly terminal-based Wi-Fi interface
written in Go. It provides a text-based user interface (TUI)
for managing wireless connections directly from the console,
supporting both NetworkManager and iwd through D-Bus.

This tool is ideal for lightweight desktop environments or
console-only setups where you want to avoid running graphical
applets such as nm-applet. It offers an experience similar to
nmtui but with a more modern and colorful interface.

Features:
 - Connect, disconnect, and manage Wi-Fi networks.
 - Supports both NetworkManager and iwd backends.
 - Fully keyboard-driven TUI (no mouse required).
 - Written in Go and distributed under the MIT license.

NOTE: this script need network access to download modules
during build.
