DNS utility

ZDNS is a utility for performing fast DNS lookups, such as completing
an A lookup for all names in a zone file, or collecting CAA records
for a large number of websites. ZDNS contains its own recursive
resolver and supports A, AAAA, ANY, AXFR, CAA, CNAME, DMARC, MX, NS,
PTR, TXT, SOA, and SPF records.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
