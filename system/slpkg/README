Slpkg is a software package manager that installs, updates,
and removes packages on Slackware-based systems. It automatically
calculates dependencies and determines the required steps for package
installation. Slpkg simplifies managing machine groups by eliminating
manual updates.
The tool adheres to the standards of the slackbuilds.org organization
for building packages and follows Slackware Linux's procedures for
package installation, upgrades, and removal.
