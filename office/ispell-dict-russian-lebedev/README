ispell-dict-russian-lebedev is the Russian spellchecking dictionary
for ispell.

This package has been patched to support utf-8 and is shipping two
versions of the dictionary/affixfile: "ye-version" and "yo-version".

The differ by treating the letter "yo" as unnecessary/mandatory.

If somebody needs a ye-yo version, drop me a line, but this build is
here mostly for historical reasons, for all intents and puroposes it
is better to move to aspell/hunspell/nuspell/myspell/enchant.

Check that it works run this command and check output:

echo пестрый | ispell -d russian-lebedev-yo
@(#) International Ispell Version 3.4.04 02 Jun 2021
word: how about: пестрей, пестры, пёстрый
