flexiblas (BLAS and LAPACK wrapper library)

FlexiBLAS is a wrapper library that enables the exchange of the BLAS
(Basic Linear Algebra System) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage)
implementation used in an executable without recompiling or
re-linking it.

The FlexiBLAS library provides a GNU Fortran compatible interface to
all functions and subroutines provided by the Netlib reference
implementations.

As backends FlexiBLAS can employ all BLAS and LAPACK implementations
which consist of a single shared library directly. Other variants
like the Intel MKL or ATLAS that use multiple files are integrated
by FlexiBLAS by wrapping all files into a single surrogate library.
