girara (GTK+ based GUI for text-oriented applications)

girara is a library that implements a user interface that focuses on
simplicity and minimalism. girara was designed to replace and enhance
the user interface that is used by zathura and jumanji and other
features that those applications share.

Note: this is not the latest version of girara; the latest version
requires a newer pango than Slackware 15.0 has.
