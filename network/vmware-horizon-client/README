The VMware Horizon Client for Linux, allowing you to use your Slackware box as a
thin client and lets you connect to your company's Virtual Desktop
Infrastructure using the proprietary VMware View 6 PCoIP protocol.

*ATTENTION*: This build script installs binary, proprietary software. Only use
it if you need the proprietary parts and you are ok with installing and using
proprietary software. By installing this SlackBuild you agree to the EULA you'll
find installed in /usr/doc/vmware-horizon-client-8.4.0/. If you do not agree,
uninstall the package.

This SlackBuild installs multiple components. At the moment only the PCoIP and
the Smart Card component seem to work. USB redirection and Virtual Printing
won't work. 

This SlackBuild unconditionally installs the components client, pcoip, hosted-apps
and no others, because I can only test these. Please feel free to add other
components (smartcard, USB redirection, AV redirection) if you need them
and can test.

This application is a 64bit one.
