Gaupol is an editor for text-based subtitle files. It supports
multiple subtitle file formats and provides means of correcting
texts and timing subtitles to match video. The user interface is
designed with attention to batch processing of multiple documents and
convenience of translating.

Gaupol should run on all Unix-like (GNU/Linux, *BSD, etc.) operating
systems and on Windows. Technically, it should run on Mac as well, but
that has not been tested nor made convenient. Gaupol's user interface
is based on the GTK+ toolkit and has been designed to best fit the
GNOME desktop environment.

Optional dependencies are:

- pyenchant 1.1.3 or greater is required for spell-checking. 
  Additionally, spell-checking requires a dictionary, any of
  Aspell/Pspell, Ispell, MySpell, Uspell, Hspell or AppleSpell.

- iso-codes, if available, will be used to translate script, language
  and country names.

- MPlayer or VLC is recommended for preview.
