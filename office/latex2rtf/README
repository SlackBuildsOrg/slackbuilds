latex2rtf is a translator program to convert LaTeX formatted text
files into "rich text format" (RTF) files. RTF is a published standard
format by Microsoft. This standard can be ambiguous in places, but RTF
is supported by many text editors. Specifically, it is supported by
Microsoft Word. This means that the conversion of a LaTeX document to
RTF allows anyone with a copy of Word to convert LaTeX files to Word
.doc or .docx files.

Features

- Conversion of a wide range of input encodings
- Conversion of equations (unfortunately using the broken Microsoft
  implementation of EQ fields)
- Conversion of tables
- Conversion of graphics
- Conversion of cross-references
- Conversion of bibliographies 

latex2rtf translates the text and as much of the formatting
information from LaTeX to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output
is not nearly as good as what you would get from using LaTeX directly.
