tightvnc (VNC viewing application)

TightVNC is a free remote control software package. With TightVNC, you can
see the desktop of a remote machine and control it with your local mouse and
keyboard, just like you would do it sitting in the front of that computer.

TightVNC is:

* free for both personal and commercial usage, with full source code available
* useful in administration, tech support, education, and many other purposes
* cross-platform, available for Windows and Unix, with Java client included
* compatible with standard VNC software, conforming to RFB protocol specs

TightVNC also ships with Xvnc, a headless X server that speaks the VNC
protocol.

NOTE: vncserver/Xvnc requires a configuration file (tightvncserver.conf) in
/etc to operate.  A suitable, basic, configuration file is by this slackbuild
in /usr/doc/tightvnc-1.3.10.  Copy this file to /etc before attempting to
launch vncserver/Xvnc.

Also included is a small, optional, patch to vncserver (vncserver.patch),
contributed by Andrei Desculì–¢, which modifies the vncserver startup to use
the system configured xinitrc instead of the minimal xterm/twm configuration 
used by default.  Note that if you have launched vncserver prior to applying
the optional patch, you will need to remove the $HOME/.vnc/xstartup file to
use the alternate configuration.  If you wish to use the optional patch, you
will need to apply it manually (i.e., using the 'patch' command from the
command line).
