Caja is the default file manager for the MATE Desktop Environment.
It makes it easy to manage, manipulate, and customize files and
directories. Caja can access local and remote filesystems such as
SSH, FTP, and WebDav (HTTP/HTTPS).

Caja also provides the desktop background and the icons it uses for
launching links and applications, as well as accessing files,
directories, the trash, and removable media like
CD/DVD/BD and USB drives.
