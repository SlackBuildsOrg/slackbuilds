rakarrack (realtime audio effects processor for JACK)

Rakarrack is a richly featured multi-effects processor emulating a
guitar effects pedalboard. It includes such effects as distortion,
echo, reverb, phaser, flanger, chorus, compressor, etc.

Build option: SSE. Normally, SSE and SSE2 are autodetected. If you
need to build without SSE and SSE2 support on a machine that supports
them (e.g. you're going to install the package on an old machine that
lacks SSE/SSE2), you can set SSE=no in the script's environment to
disable SSE and SSE2.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
