ClusterSSH is a tool for making the same change on multiple
servers at the same time. The 'cssh' command opens an administration
console and an xterm to all specified hosts. Any text typed into the
administration console is replicated to all windows. All windows may
also be typed into directly.

This tool is intended for (but not limited to) cluster administration
where the same configuration or commands must be run on each node
within the cluster.  Performing these commands all at once via this
tool ensures all nodes are kept in sync.
