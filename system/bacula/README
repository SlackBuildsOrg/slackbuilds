Bacula (Manage backup, recovery) - Client and server

Bacula is a set of Open Source, computer programs that permit
you (or the system administrator) to manage backup, recovery,
and verification of computer data across a network of computers of
different kinds. Bacula is relatively easy to use and very efficient,
while offering many advanced storage management features that make it
easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. In technical terms,
it is an Open Source, network based backup program.

This script has a few build options:

  DATABASE=auto|mysql|postgresql|sqlite

                         core dumps
