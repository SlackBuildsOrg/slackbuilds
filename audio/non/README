Non is a modular (in the Unix sense) DAW, and is designed
to be fast enough to run on low-end processors.

This SlackBuild builds the Non mixer, sequencer, timeline, and
session-manager, which can be used together or independently.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY:

The `import-ardour-session` script requires Python2.
This script hasn't been updated in years, and may not successfully
import a modern Ardour project file, so this is an optional
dependency and subject to your own experimentation.
