ZFS is a modern filesystem originally developed for Solaris. It provides
many functionalities such as snapshots, data compression, data recovery,
filesystem (snapshot) sending/reveiving, and more.

NOTES

- You'll need the kernel source code to be able to compile this. This
  package is kernel dependent, so you'll need to recompile it for every
  new kernel you choose to run.

- Please use KERNEL environment variable if target kernel version
  differs from that of the build machine, e.g. `export KERNEL=5.15.116`.

- Dracut support is compiled in if dracut is installed at the time of
  building.

- Openzfs requires i686 on Slackware-x86. i586 will fail to build.
