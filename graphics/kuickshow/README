KuickShow v0.8
Carsten Pfeiffer <pfeiffer@kde.org>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
KuickShow is a very fast and comfortable imageviewer, somewhat inspired
by ACDSee (early versions :)

See http://invent.kde.org/graphics/kuickshow/ for updated versions,
see ChangeLog for what has changed.
