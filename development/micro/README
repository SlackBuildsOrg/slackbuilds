micro is a terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use
and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the capabilities
of modern terminals.

As its name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a
successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use.
It strives to be enjoyable as a full-time editor for people who
prefer to work in a terminal, or those who regularly edit files
over SSH.

Optional Dependencies
----------------------
On Linux, clipboard support requires:

  On X11, the xclip or xsel commands (Available on SBo)
  On Wayland, the wl-clipboard command

If you don't have these commands, micro will use an internal
clipboard for copy and paste, but it won't work with
external applications.
