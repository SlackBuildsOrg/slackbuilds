rejoystick (translates joystick movement/buttons to keystrokes)

Rejoystick is a program that maps movement and button presses on
your gamepad/joypad/joystick to keypresses on a keyboard when you
are running X. Since it uses SDL to communicate with the gamepad
device, it can work on every platform that provides SDL and an X
environment. (Though it is yet to be tested on Cygwin e.g.)

Quickstart: run "rejoystick" with no arguments. Use the GUI to set up
button and axis key mappings. Click OK to exit. Run "rejoystick -d",
which runs in the background; moving the joystick should send the
keystrokes you configured. To exit, "killall -9 rejoystick".
