The Intel HEX file format is widely used in microprocessors
and microcontrollers area (embedded systems etc) as the
de facto standard for representation of code to be programmed
into microelectronic devices.

This work implements an intelhex Python library to read,
write, create from scratch and manipulate data from
Intel HEX file format.

The distribution package also includes several convenience
Python scripts, including "classic" hex2bin and bin2hex
converters and more, those based on the library itself.
Check the docs to know more.
