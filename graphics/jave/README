JavE (Java Ascii Versatile Editor) is a free Ascii Editor.

JavE is not a text-editor in the common sense (like Notepad or Word),
it is a graphics-editor for editing texts. The main difference to a
text-editor is, that you can edit your text in a two-dimensional
way. You can position your cursor everywhere you want and just start
typing.
