AppArmor protects systems from insecure or untrusted processes by
running them in restricted confinement, while still allowing processes
to share files, exercise privilege and communicate with other
processes. AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanism
which uses the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework.

Note that in order to use AppArmor, you need to have
CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR setting enabled in the kernel (which is not
enabled by default in Slackware). So in order to use this, you need
to reconfigure & recompile your kernel.
