SerialDV is inspired from the OpenDV project but retains only the
minimal interface to encode and decode audio with AMBE3000 based
devices in packet mode over a serial link.

SerialDV is designed with the following assumptions:

- One object controls one device in one thread. It is up to you to
  control the device in a separate thread or create a pool of threads
  for a pool of devices with load balancing. No fancy stuff here
  because fancy stuff depends too much on the environment.
- The library manages the atomic operations of decoding one AMBE frame
  or encoding one audio frame in query/reply pairs or transactions.
  Each query is returned a complete reply or an error. There is no
  queuing mechanism whatsoever.
- AMBE3000 chip has many modes and features the scope of this library
  is to provide an easy to use interface for the most popular digital
  voice modes i.e. D-Star and the DMR likes (DMR, YSF, P25, ...). Some
  more may be added in the future if the need arises.
- It will work for both encoding and decoding
