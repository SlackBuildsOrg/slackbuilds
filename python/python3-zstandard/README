This project provides Python bindings for interfacing with the
Zstandard compression library. A C extension and CFFI interface
are provided.

The primary goal of the project is to provide a rich interface
to the underlying C API through a Pythonic interface while not
sacrificing performance. This means exposing most of the features
and flexibility of the C API while not sacrificing usability or
safety that Python provides.
