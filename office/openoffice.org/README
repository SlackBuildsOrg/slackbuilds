OpenOffice.org is a full-featured open-source office suite that is
compatible with all other major office software.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's)
distributed by openoffice.org.
The default GTK theme is replaced with 'Adwaita', but if instead you'd
like to use the default 'Raleigh', set the option DEFAULT_TO_RALEIGH
to 'YES', i.e.:

DEFAULT_TO_RALEIGH='YES' ./openoffice.org.SlackBuild

Apache recommends having either jre or jdk installed, but it is not
required. See more details here:

NOTE: submenus
By default, the menu entries grouped in a submenu folder
(multilevel menu entry). If you want to disable this, do:

SUBMENU="NO" ./openoffice.org.SlackBuild
