kSAR (GitHub) is a continuation of kSAR, a GUI for sysstat and acct

It plots the graphs that are collected by sa/sar utilities from the
sysstat and acct packages. This data collection is usually done
with cron, and should be configured separately.

I particular, the SlackBuild's author has the following in his
crontab:

```
* * * * * /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 10 6 -S DISK
0 0 * * * /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 --rotate
```

You need Java 8 or later to run this package. The slackbuild 
author uses zulu-openjdk11, but other versions might work.
