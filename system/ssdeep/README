ssdeep (program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes)

ssdeep computes a checksum based on context triggered piecewise
hashes (fuzzy hashes) for each input file. If requested, the program
matches those checksums against a file of known checksums and reports
any possible matches. It can also examine one or more of signatures
and find any matches in those signatures.
