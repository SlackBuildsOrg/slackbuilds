Open Shading Language (OSL) is a small but rich language for
programmable shading in advanced renderers and other applications,
ideal for describing materials, lights, displacement, and pattern
generation.

OSL was originally developed by Sony Pictures Imageworks for use in its
in- house renderer used for feature film animation and visual effects,
released as open source so it could be used by other visual effects and
animation studios and rendering software vendors. Now it's the de facto
standard shading language for VFX and animated features, used across
the industry in many commercial and studio- proprietary renderers.

Cuda and OptIx are optional dependencies but they are not tested.

Warning
OSL is an optional dependency for Blender autodetected. Unfortunately
the build of Blender version available in this repository (3.3.10)
with the support to OSL fails, perhaps because Slackware 15.0
development packages could be outdated. In order to prevent compilation
errors, the slackbuild of Blender will disable the support to OSL if
this dependency is installed in your system, so you can install OSL
without conflicts with the build of Blender.
In Slackware current Blender 4.4.3 builds fine against OSL 1.14.6 and
OpenImageIO 3.0.7.0.
