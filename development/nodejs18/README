Node.js 18.x (LTS) is a JavaScript runtime environment.

Node.js 18.x (LTS) uses a model of event-driven,
non-blocking I/O that makes it efficient.  The npm
JavaScript package manager is included.

This is a Long Term Support version, and will only
be updated with bug and security fixes.

NOTE: The nodejs18 SlackBuild conflicts with the
      nodejs SlackBuild.
