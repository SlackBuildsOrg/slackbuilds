The MacroMolecular Transmission Format (MMTF) is a binary encoding of
biological structures. It includes the coordinates, the topology and
associated data. Specifically, a large subset of the data in mmCIF or
PDB files can be represented. Pronounced goals are a reduced file size
for efficient transmission over the Internet or from hard disk to
memory and fast decoding/parsing speed.

This slackbuild does not compile but install the C++ headers needed to
compile sources that supports it, e.g. Avogadro 2.
