Audacity is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds.
With Audacity one can record live audio, convert tapes and records into
digital recordings, edit Ogg, MP3, and WAV sound files, and much more.

Optional dependencies (autodetected) are jack, ladspa_sdk, soundtouch,
twolame, vamp-plugin-sdk and vst3sdk.

The manual is packaged with the application only if you pass the script
the additional option
  MANUAL=yes

NOTE: for audacity to build/run wxWidgets needs to be built with
support for gtk+3 (it won't work if you build it against qt)
