Sway is a tiling Wayland compositor and a drop-in replacement
for the i3 window manager for X11.

It works with your existing i3 configuration and supports
most of i3's features, plus a few extras.

Sway allows you to arrange your application windows logically,
rather than spatially. Windows are arranged into a grid by default
which maximizes the efficiency of your screen and can be quickly
manipulated using only the keyboard.


Sway config: make a sway directory in your /home/(user).config dir
copy config file from /etc/sway to  /home/(user)/.config/sway
edit the config file to your taste.

You'll need a menu launcher like for example bemenu or others.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:

grim for screenshots.
alacritty terminal or native wayland terminal like foot.
waybar or yambar for wayland bar.
