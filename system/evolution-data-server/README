Evolution Data Server manages access to the calendar, tasks and 
addressbook information available for Evolution and other applications.

It is a CORBA component which, when activated, allows concurrent access 
by several client applications to the same data, adding to that 
notifications of changes, which are signalled to all clients. 

Its extensible architecture, allows the addition of plugins to manage 
different kinds of calendar/tasks/addressbook sources, by just writing 
a shared library, which will be loaded by evolution-data-server on 
startup. 

Below variables can be used to configure the build:
    INTROSPECTION=yes : Enable GObject introspection
                        the dependecies must be compiled with 
                        introspection or the build will fail.
    VALA=yes          : Generate VALA bindings
                        Requires INTROSPECTION=YES
    GTKDOC=yes        : Use gtk-doc to build documentation
    TESTS=yes         : Enable installed tests
    GCOV=yes          : Enable build with GCOV code coverage
                        Requires gcov
