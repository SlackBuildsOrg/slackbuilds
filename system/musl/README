Musl is a C standard library that is lightweight, fast, simple, free,
and strives to be correct in the sense of standards-conformance and
safety.

Musl includes a wrapper, musl-gcc, for building files linked against
musl. It also provides musl-ldd to print the shared libraries loaded
by the musl loader.
