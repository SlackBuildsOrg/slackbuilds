rss2email (rss to email gateway)

A python script that forward RSS feeds to your email address. This
allows you to view RSS feeds in an interface you are already familiar
with, and to apply filters to incoming feeds. Normally, you'll want
to run it from your crontab.

It is the community maintained successor to the rss2email by Aaron
Swartz.

The executable and man page are called r2e.
