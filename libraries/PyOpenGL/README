PyOpenGL is the cross platform Python binding to OpenGL and related
APIs. The binding is created using the standard (in Python 2.5 and
above) ctypes library and is provided under a BSD-style Open-Source
license.

PyOpenGL includes support for OpenGL v1.1 through 3.2, GLU, GLUT v3.7
(and FreeGLUT), and GLE 3. It also has support for hundreds of OpenGL
extensions.

PyOpenGL is interoperable with a large number of external GUI
libraries for Python including wxPython, Pygame, PyGTK, and Qt.
It can also use the GLUT library to provide basic windowing and user
interface mechanisms.
