This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using
open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These libraries can be
used to build streaming applications.

Since version 2014.08.26, library and include files are arranged to be
easily discoverable by configuration stage when building vlc.

Since version 2014.11.02, source tarballs from archive at
sourceforge.net are used, only the very latest tarball being available
from http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/.

Until vlc (which depends on live555) is updated to accommodate changed
API in live555-2021.01.13, live555 will be held at version 2020.08.19
