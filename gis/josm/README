JOSM is an extensible editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM) written in Java

Currently it supports loading stand-alone GPX tracks and GPX track
data from the OSM database as well as loading and editing existing
nodes, ways, metadata tags and relations from the OSM database.

Josm is very active so it is highly recommended to install the latest
version http://josm.openstreetmap.de/download/josm-tested.jar and
execute the script with VERSION=tested

The script will automagically find the version number in packaging.
