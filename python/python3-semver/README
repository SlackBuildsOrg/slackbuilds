A Python module to simplify semantic versioning.

The module follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH style:
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards
  compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are supported.
