The Multipath TCP Daemon is a daemon for Linux based operating systems
that performs multipath TCP path management related operations in the
user space. It interacts with the Linux kernel through a generic
netlink connection to track per-connection information (e.g. available
remote addresses), available network interfaces, request new MPTCP
subflows, handle requests for subflows, etc.
