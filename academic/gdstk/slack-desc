# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gdstk: gdstk (C++ library for manipulation of GDSII and OASIS files. )
gdstk:
gdstk: Gdstk (GDSII Tool Kit) is a C++ library for creation and
gdstk: manipulation of GDSII and OASIS files. It is also available as a
gdstk: Python module meant to be a successor to Gdspy. Key features for the
gdstk: creation of complex CAD layouts are included: Boolean operations on
gdstk: polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping algorithm, Polygon
gdstk: offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons), Efficient
gdstk: point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets.
gdstk: Typical applications of Gdstk are in the fields of electronic chip
gdstk: design, planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.
