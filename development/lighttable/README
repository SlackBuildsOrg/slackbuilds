Light Table is a new interactive IDE that lets you modify running
programs and embed anything from websites to games.

It provides the real time feedback we need to not only answer
questions about our code, but to understand how our programs
really work.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
