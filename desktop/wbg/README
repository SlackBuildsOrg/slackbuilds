Super simple wallpaper application for Wayland compositors implementing
the layer-shell protocol.
Wbg takes a single command line argument: a path to an image file.
This image is displayed scaled-to-fit on all monitors.
More display options, and/or the ability to set a per-monitor wallpaper
may be added in the future.
