GMT is an open-source collection of command-line tools for manipulating
geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting,
gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing PostScript illustrations
ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially
illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views. It supports many map
projections and transformations and includes supporting data such as
coastlines, rivers, and political boundaries and optionally country
polygons.

By default, GMT will use Dave Watson's Delaunay triangulation routine.
However, a much faster alternative is available from Jonathan Shewchuk,
but his routine is not distributed under the GNU Public License.
In order to use the Shewchuk's routine you have to launch the script
by passing the SHEWCHUK parameter:

  SHEWCHUK=yes ./GMT.SlackBuild

For movie-making capabilities the following dependencies are needed:

  GraphicsMagick
  ffmpeg

Other optional dependencies are:

  blas
  lapack

Modules documentation can be accessed via the "gmt docs <module_name>"
command (e.g. gmt docs psxy).

For more details refer to the README.md and LICENSE.TXT files contained
into the GMT sources.
