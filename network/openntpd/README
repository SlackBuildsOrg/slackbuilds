OpenNTPD is a FREE, easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote
NTP servers and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local
clock.

OpenNTPD was primarily developed by Henning Brauer as part of the
OpenBSD Project and gets released as a base component of OpenBSD every
six months.

The portable version is maintained by Brent Cook and is mirrored on
Github and available as periodic tarball releases. Contributions are
welcome to both the OpenNTPD core and the portable build framework.

This build script will try to create the user and group '_ntp', that is
necessary to run openntpd.
