Isabelle is a generic proof assistant. It allows mathematical formulas
to be expressed in a formal language and provides tools for proving
those formulas in a logical calculus. Isabelle was originally
developed at the University of Cambridge and Technische Universität
München, but now includes numerous contributions from institutions and
individuals worldwide.

Isabelle is written in polyML, Java, and Scala, but does not require
them to be installed from SBo.

This build is bundling: jEdit, vscodium, jdk-17, so be careful about
its interference with other packages.

A lot of proofs certified with Isabelle can be found on
https://www.isa-afp.org/

This build repackages the binary build.
