XMenu is a desktop menu utility for the X11 window system.
XMenu receives a menu specification in stdin, shows a menu for the user
to select one of the options, and outputs the selected option to stdout.

Features:
- Reads something in and prints something out, the UNIX way.
- Menu hierarchies (submenus).
- Icons and separators.
- Optional alternate activation (click a menu entry with middle-button).
- Customization via X resources.
- Multi-monitor support (via Xinerama).
- File navigation via menus (see “-f”)
- Torn-off (detachable) menus (see “-w”).
- Fine window management hints (see “-p” and “-t”).
- Use as a standalone desktop start-menu (see “-x”).
