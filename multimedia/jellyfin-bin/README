Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts you in control 
of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no 
strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.

By default, jellyfin will use below folders:
 -Data /opt/jellyfin/data
 -Cache /opt/jellyfin/cache
 -Log /opt/jellyfin/log
 -Config /opt/jellyfin/config
To change them, edit /etc/default/jellyfin
