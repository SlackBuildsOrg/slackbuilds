The kernel-source-xanmod-rt pakage is a copy of the xanmod-rt
source code installed in /usr/src/ without touching the
linux symbolic link in /usr/src. If you apply patches after
you installed kernel-source-xanmod, you need to copy them into
the source directory, the other package scripts will only read
the config file and look patches there and apply them on this
packages tar. This way you can also build the kernel manually
and try out changes and configurations before you save them,
keeping manually building and packaging the kernel separated
and simple with all options available. Point to you config file
and patch directory with a leading "/", if you don't it will be
relative to /tmp/SBo/package-kernel-source-xanmod-rt/usr/src/linux../
that is probably not what you want.

PATCH_DIR=/full/path/to/the/directory/patches
CONFIG=/full/path/to/kernel/config/file

This are the packages will be based on the config and
patches found in /usr/src/linux-5.15.*-rt*-xanmod1
provided by this package. Patches need to be in the format
.patch or .patch.xz

kernel-generic-xanmod-rt
kernel-headers-xanmod-rt
kernel-modules-xanmod-rt

Everything is set to be verbose. Analyse the output
to see how the patching went and from where the config
was copied.

Pleas give feedback, if you see something in kernel config or in the
script that you think could be better. E-mail me or open pull request
on git against this packages.
