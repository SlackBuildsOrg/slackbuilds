libax25 AX.25 Packet radio support for linux.

The AX.25 protocol offers both connected and connectionless modes of
operation, and is used either by itself for point-point links, or to
carry other protocols such as TCP/IP and NET/ROM.

It is similar to X.25 level 2 in structure, with some extensions to
make it more useful in the amateur radio environment.

This library is for ham radio applications that use the ax25 protocol.
Included are routines to do ax25 address parsing, common ax25
application config file parsing, etc.
