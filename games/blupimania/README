Blupimania is a modern port of the Epsitec SA 1994 game.

It features a little yellow guy called Blupi facing various puzzles.

Blupi comes out of a hole holding on to a balloon.
Unfortunately he let's it blow away.
Blupi is lost, he turns to the left or the right and does various
unpredictable things of his own.
The object of the game is to help him find another balloon, so that he
can move on to the next riddle.
Blupimania offers the option of creating your own riddles in level 5.
