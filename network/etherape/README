EtherApe is a graphical network monitor modeled after
etherman. Featuring Ethernet, IP, TCP, FDDI and Token Ring modes, it
displays network activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size
with traffic. Color coded protocols display.

It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It
can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well
as live from the network.

This build will set the kdesu su wrapper when called from the GUI
desktop pass. If not enabled, etherape will not monitor the ports if
not called by root.
