nrpe (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor)

The NRPE addon is designed to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on
remote Linux/Unix machines. The main reason for doing this is to allow
Nagios to monitor "local" resources (like CPU load, memory usage,
etc.) remote machines. Since these public resources are not usually
exposed to external machines, an agent like NRPE must be installed on
the remote Linux/Unix machines.
