Traitlets is a pure Python library enabling:

* the enforcement of strong typing for attributes of Python objects (typed
  attributes are called "traits")
* notifications on changes of trait attributes
* automatic validation and coercion of trait attributes when attempting a
  change

Its implementation relies on the descriptor pattern.

Traitlets powers the configuration system of IPython and Jupyter and the
declarative API of IPython interactive widgets.
