# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Getopt-Long-Descriptive:
perl-Getopt-Long-Descriptive: It also provides usage (help) messages, data validation, and a few
perl-Getopt-Long-Descriptive: other useful features.
