Hiawatha (A secure and advanced webserver)

Hiawatha is a web server for Unix and has been built with security in
mind. This resulted in a highly secure web server, in both code and
features.

Hiawatha supports many web and HTTP features such as CGI/FASTCGI, HTTP
authentication, virtual host support, request pipelining, keep alive
connections, URL rewriting and many more.

Notes:

  To use this package the user and group 'hiawatha' are required.
  You can create them with:

  # groupadd -g 259 hiawatha
  # useradd -u 259 -g 259 -c "Hiawatha HTTP Server" -d / \
          -s /bin/false hiawatha

  By default:

  * Hiawatha's daemon will listen on the network interface
    127.0.0.1:80, and it can write temporary files inside
    /var/db/hiawatha

  * The web root directory is /var/hiawatha with index.html being
    the default start file.
