Changelog for libavif slackbuild script
--------------------------------------------------------------------

01/10/2022:

Added to slackbuilds.org

06/01/2023:

Updated README
Updated to github commit 93035c1

Pandoc is used by libavif to build man pages. If you don't need
manpages don't install pandoc and change the appropriate
build option.

For x86 architecture pandoc will be an optional dependency.
pandoc needs to be built from sources for x86 architecture
since it takes much time to build, I'm not building
the manpages by default. If you need manpages
install pandoc and then customize the slackbuild script by
changing the build option for manpages from OFF to ON.

15/05/2023:

updated to github commit 94352e0
updated Deps in info file and README

From this build onward man pages are not built by default
hence pandoc will now be an optional dependency for all
architectures. Gtest needs to be installed if want to build
test during compile time, by default this is turned off.
