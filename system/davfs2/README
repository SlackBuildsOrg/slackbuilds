Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to
the HTTP- protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote web
server. davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like a
typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no
built-in support for WebDAV.

Before running this SlackBuild, define a davfs2 group and a davfs2
user. The davfs2 user shall have davfs2 as its initial login
group, shall not have no shell and the home directory shall be
/var/cache/davfs. Examples:

# groupadd -g 230 davfs2
# useradd -u 230 -d /var/cache/davfs2 -g davfs2 -s /bin/false davfs2
