The sqldiff binary is a command-line utility program that displays the
differences between SQLite databases.

Example usage:
sqldiff [options] database1.sqlite database2.sqlite

The usual output is an SQL script that will transform database1.sqlite
(the "source" database) into database2.sqlite (the "destination"
database).

sqldiff is part of SQLite, it comes inside the tools directory of
the SQLite sources. It isn't included in the stock slackware SQLite
package. Hence this SlackBuild follows the Slackware SQLite version
and compilation options. This is why the sources used are linked
from Slackware mirrors, to ensure maximum compatibility with stock
Slackware.
