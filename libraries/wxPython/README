wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language.
It allows Python programmers to create programs with a robust,
highly functional graphical user interface simply and easily.  It is
implemented as a Python extension module (native code) that wraps the
popular wxWidgets cross platform GUI library which is written in C++.

If you want support for gnomeprint pass GNOMEPRINT=yes to the
script. This will require libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui, both
available from SlackBuilds.org.

Another optional dependency is libmspack, which is used by the CHM help
viewer.

wxPython is a port of wxWidgets and as such compatible to other ports
like wxGTK and wxX11. Note that SlackBuilds.org builds are only tested
with wxPython (not wxGTK or wxX11), so this is the correct package to
install unless you have very specific and weird requirements.

wxPython can be installed alongside wxGTK3, but it will overwrite the
/usr/bin/wx-config created by wxGTK3.

If you need to build packages using wxGTK3, simply reinstall the
wxGTK3 package and wx-config will point to correct version.

The same solution can be used if wxPython's wx-config is overwritten.

We are in the process of updating all scripts that use wxGTK3 or
wxPython to ignore the wx-config symlink at build time, so this will
stop being a problem some time in the future.
