yamagi-quake2 (Yamagi Quake II Client)

Yamagi Quake II is an enhanced client for id Software's Quake II with
focus on offline and cooperative gameplay.

Both the gameplay and the graphics are unchanged, but many bugs in
the last official release were fixed and some nice to have features
like widescreen support and a modern OpenGL 3.2 renderer were added.

In comparison with the original client Yamagi Quake II is fully 64-bit
clean and works perfectly on modern processors and operating systems.

Before playing, copy your Quake2 data files into the appropriate
subdirectories of /usr/share/quake2 ( or "$HOME/.yq2"). Please refer
to the README files in /usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-8.60/ for details.

To get a reasonable default configuration, copy
/usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-8.60/yq2.cfg to your baseq2 directory.
