Matplotlib strives to produce publication quality 2D graphics for
interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface
development and web application servers targeting multiple user
interfaces and hardcopy output formats.  The 'pylab' mode
of ipython uses matplotlib to emulate matlab graphics.

This is the Python 3 version of matplotlib and can coexist with
SBo's matplotlib package.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
=====================

Only those optional dependencies are listed below which are not already
provided by Slackware, and can be installed by means of a SlackBuild.

For extended capabilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

python3-tornado
jupyter-ipykernel
wxPython4
python3-cairocffi
texlive-extra

NOTE: The LaTeX package cm-super is not provided by Slackware.
      Presently, the only way to install it through a SlackBuild is to
      use texlive-extra which is huge. You may consider installing it
      manually. The zip file is available at:
      https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-super?lang=en


For self-tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

python3-pytest
inkscape
jupyter-nbformat
jupyter-nbconvert
python3-pandas
pikepdf
python3-psutil
python3-pytest-cov
python3-pytest-timeout
pytz
Sphinx
python3-xarray

NOTES: 1) python3-pytest becomes mandatory, if one wishes to let
          matplotlib perform the self-tests.
       2) The SlackBuild has to be executed with ENABLE_TESTS set to
          "yes".
       3) The amount of performed testing depends on the optional
          dependencies installed besides python3-pytest. However,
          please note that several tests fail, if cm-super is missing,
          see also the previous note.
       4) To actually run the self-tests execute:
          pytest3 --pyargs matplotlib.tests
          as a normal user, after matplotlib got installed.
          Consider doing this from within an empty directory, since some
          "garbage" is left behind.


The present SlackBuild does not build matplotlib's documentation. This
is not planned to change any day soon.
