gcolor3 (GTK+3 color selector)

gcolor3 is a color selection dialog written in GTK+3. It is much like
gcolor2, but uses the newer GTK+ version and other modernisations to
better integrate into your modern desktop.

Ever wanted to know the value of that color on your screen? Gcolor3
enables you to pick the color from any pixel on your screen. It
also allows you to create and save a palette.

Note: I'm aware that this isn't the latest version of gcolor3. It is,
however, the last version that can be built on Slackware 15.0.
