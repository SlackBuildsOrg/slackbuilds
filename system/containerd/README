Containerd is a daemon to control runC, built for performance and
density. Containerd leverages runC's advanced features such as seccomp
and user namespace support as well as checkpoint and restore for
cloning and live migration of containers.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
