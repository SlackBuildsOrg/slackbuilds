python3-ifaddr (Python Library to enumerate all network interfaces)

ifaddr is a small Python library that allows you to find all the
Ethernet and IP addresses of the computer. It is tested on Linux,
OS X, and Windows. Other BSD derivatives like OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
and NetBSD should work too, but I haven't personally tested
those. Solaris/Illumos should also work.
