wxPdfDocument allows wxWidgets applications to generate PDF
documents. The code is a port of FPDF - a free PHP class for
generating PDF files - to C++ using the wxWidgets library.
Several add-on PHP scripts found on the FPDF web site are
incorporated into wxPdfDocument.

Embedding of PNG, JPEG, GIF and WMF images is supported. In
addition to the 14 standard Adobe fonts it is possible to use
other Type1, TrueType or OpenType fonts - with or without
embedding them into the generated document. CJK fonts are supported,
too. Graphics primitives allow the creation of simple drawings.
