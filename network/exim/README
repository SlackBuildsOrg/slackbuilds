Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) used on Unix-like operating
systems.  It is freely available under the GNU GPL and it aims
to be a general and flexible mailer with extensive facilities for
checking incoming e-mail and can be integrated with other email tools
such as Clamav, Spamassassin, Bogofilter, and others available at
Slackbuilds.org.

Exim was orginally written by Philip Hazel for use in the University of
Cambridge Computing Services e-mail systems.
