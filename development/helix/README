A Kakoune / Neovim inspired editor, written in Rust.

Features:
- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing
  via tree-sitter

If you don't want to build grammar files which provide syntax
highlighting, use HELIX_DISABLE_AUTO_GRAMMAR_BUILD=yes. Those can be
built later with:

    hx --grammar fetch; hx --grammar build

This will install them in the runtime directory within the user's helix
config directory.

In order to use system clipboard in Wayland, wl-clipboard is needed.

To build HTML documentation use DOCS=yes. This requires mdbook.
