# LogiOps
This is an unofficial driver for Logitech mice and keyboard.
This is currently only compatible with HID++ \>2.0 devices.

## Configuration
You may refer to 'logid.example.cfg' in '/usr/doc/logiops-(version)' 
for an example.
Default location for the configuration file is /etc/logid.cfg, but 
another can be specified using the `-c` flag.

## Execute daemon
To execute logid daemon at boot, you may execute (as root) the following
commands:

cat >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local <<EOF
# Start logiops daemon
if [ -x /usr/bin/logid -a -r /etc/logid.cfg ]; then
  echo "Starting logiops daemon"
  /usr/bin/logid &
fi
EOF
