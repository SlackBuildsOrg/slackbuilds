bencode (python module)

The BitTorrent bencode module as a light-weight, stand alone package.

This package simply re-packages the existing bencoding and bdecoding
implemention from the 'official' BitTorrent client as a separate,
leight-weight package for re-using them without having the entire
BitTorrent software as a dependency.
