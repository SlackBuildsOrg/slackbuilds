Nyx is a command-line monitor for Tor.

With this you can get detailed real-time information about
your relay such as bandwidth usage, connections, logs, and
much more.

Nyx works with Python 2.7 and greater, including the Python
3.x series.
Please note that Nyx by now is defacto unmaintained.

Having Tor installed is not required for building.
The Tor installation does not have to be from SBo.

A python 3 module will be compiled.
In case you need a python 2 module adapt the script.
