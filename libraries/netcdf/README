NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for
array-oriented data access and a freely-distributed collection of data
access libraries for C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages. The
netCDF libraries support a machine-independent format for representing
scientific data. Together, the interfaces, libraries, and format support
the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data.

Optional HDF4 support
---------------------

If you need support for reading HDF4 files, please build and install
the 'hdf' package from SlackBuilds.org, and then pass the option
'HDF4=yes' to the netcdf SlackBuild, for example

  HDF4=yes ./netcdf.SlackBuild

By default, the script does not build nor run the tests. You can use the
option TESTBUILD=YES to build and run the tests before the make install
part.
