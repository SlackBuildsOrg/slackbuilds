Sunwait calculates sunrise or sunset times with civil, nautical,
astronomical, and custom twilights. It is intended for use in home
automation with Windows Task Scheduler or cron. The program can wait
from invocation until the event specified on the command line occurs
or it can return immediately indicating if it is day or night.
