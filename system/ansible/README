Ansible (a ssh-based config management framework)

A radically simple, model-driven orchestration solution that automates
configuration, software deployment, and other IT needs.

It comes as an easy-to-use and powerful alternative to infrastructure
management tools such as CFEngine, Chef, Puppet, and SaltStack.

Note: for some modules to run, you may need to install additional
dependencies.
