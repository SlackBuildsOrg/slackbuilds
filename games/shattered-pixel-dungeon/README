Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a traditional roguelike dungeon crawler RPG
that’s simple to get into but hard to master!

It's based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon, by Watabou.

Every game is a unique challenge, with six different heroes,
randomized levels and enemies, and hundreds of items to collect and
use. ShatteredPD is also updated with new content roughly every three
months, so there’s always something new.
