Argcomplete provides easy, extensible command line tab completion
of arguments for your Python script.Argcomplete is particularly
useful if your program has lots of options or subparsers, and
if your program can dynamically suggest completions for
your argument/option values.

It makes two assumptions:

* You're using bash as your shell
* You're using argparse to manage your 
  command line arguments/options
