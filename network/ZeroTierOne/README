ZeroTier lets you build modern, secure multi-point virtualized
networks of almost any type. 
From robust peer-to-peer networking to multi-cloud mesh
infrastructure, we enable global connectivity with the simplicity
of a local network.

ZeroTier is a smart programmable Ethernet switch for planet Earth.
It allows all networked devices, VMs, containers, and applications
to communicate as if they all reside in the same physical data center
or cloud region.

This is accomplished by combining a cryptographically addressed and
secure peer to peer network (termed VL1) with an Ethernet emulation
layer somewhat similar to VXLAN (termed VL2).
Our VL2 Ethernet virtualization layer includes advanced enterprise
SDN features like fine grained access control rules for network
micro-segmentation and security monitoring.

All ZeroTier traffic is encrypted end-to-end using secret keys that
only you control. Most traffic flows peer to peer, though we offer
free (but slow) relaying for users who cannot establish peer to peer
connections.

It is required to create an online account (free) and to configure a
"network" in the online management portal for this software to work
properly.
Visit ZeroTier's site for more information.

Apps for Android and iOS are available for free in the Google Play
and Apple app stores.

The only binary, zerotier-one, has three functions and can act as
the service daemon, the cli client utility and an identity management
utility.  Please check the man pages.

For convenience, an rc script is provided to manage the daemon.

Please check the cargo-c and rust16 pages at slackbuids.org and make
sure that you follow the guidelines regarding the export statements
in the latter slackbuild.
