jupyter-qtconsole provides a rich Qt-based console for working with
Jupyter kernels, supporting rich media output, session export, and
more.

The Qt console is a very lightweight application that largely feels
like a terminal, but provides a number of enhancements only possible
in a GUI, such as inline figures, proper multiline editing with syntax
highlighting, graphical calltips, and more.
