ff8dls (DLS soundfont for use with fmodapi)

A soundfont to be used with DLS compatible MIDI devices, including the
fmodapi package from slackbuilds.org.

This is a General MIDI soundfont designed to sound like the PlayStation,
specifically the game "Final Fantasy 8". It sounds pretty good with Doom
source ports, too (zdoom, gzdoom, and skulltag support FMOD).

To use with zdoom, gzdoom, or skulltag, set the MIDI device
to FMOD from the in-game Options menu, and set the variable
snd_midipatchset=/usr/share/sounds/dls/ff8.dls in the game console or
the config file.

For Slackware 15.0, this requires an updated libarchive package, at
least version 3.6.0. You can update libarchive with slackpkg, if you
haven't already kept up with the latest updates.
