SMPEG is a free MPEG1 video player library with sound support. Video
playback is based on the ubiquitous Berkeley MPEG player, mpeg_play
v2.2. Audio is played through a slightly modified mpegsound library,
part of Splay v0.8.2. SMPEG supports MPEG audio (MP3), MPEG-1 video,
and MPEG system streams.
