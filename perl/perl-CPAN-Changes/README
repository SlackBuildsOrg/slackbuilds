It is standard practice to include a Changes file in your
distribution. The purpose the Changes file is to help a user figure
out what has changed since the last release.

People have devised many ways to write the Changes file. A preliminary
specification has been created (CPAN::Changes::Spec) to encourage module
authors to write clear and concise Changes.

This module will help users programmatically read and write Changes
files that conform to the specification.
