Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser forked from
pre-Australis Mozilla Firefox aiming to be fast, efficient and easy to
use.

This SlackBuild just repackages the binary package provided by the
project.  It doesn't attempt to build the browser from source.

You can force Pale Moon to use system-provided hunspell instead of its
own dictionary by passing the USE_SYSTEM_SPELLCHECK=yes variable to
the script.

If you need to change the GUI language, please visit
https://www.palemoon.org/langpacks.shtml and follow the installation
instructions.

NOTE: 32 bit packages have been discontinued; and 64 bit binaries are
now released in gtk2 and gtk3 variations. If you desire to use a gtk3
variation, pass the variable GTK=gtk3 to the script.
