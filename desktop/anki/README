Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is
a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either
greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the
amount you learn.

Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit
from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio,
videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are
endless.

This binary distribution of Anki includes PyQt6, AQT, and Protobuf.
