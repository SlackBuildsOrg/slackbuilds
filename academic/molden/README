MOLDEN a pre- and post processing program of molecular and electronic 
structure

Molden is a package for displaying Molecular Density from the Ab Initio
packages GAMESS-UK, GAMESS-US, GAUSSIAN, ADF, and the Semi-Empirical 
packages Mopac/Ampac, it also supports a number of other programs via 
the Molden Format. Molden reads all the required input information from
the GAMESS / GAUSSIAN outputfile. Molden is capable of displaying 
Molecular Orbitals, the electron density and the Molecular minus atomic
density.

The SlackBuild seems to hang a bit before the build starts. 
This is normal.

surf is renamed to molden-surf and docker is renamed to molden-docker to
avoid conflict with other software called surf and docker.
