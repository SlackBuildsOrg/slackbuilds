pacoteco: SlackBuild Instructions
=================================

Overview
--------
This file explains how to use the `pacoteco.SlackBuild` script to build
and package the `pacoteco` tool for Slackware. It focuses on
SlackBuild-specific details and common challenges.

SlackBuild Usage
----------------
1. Ensure source files are in `pacoteco-devel/src/pacoteco-VERSION-src/`
(e.g., `pacoteco-1.0-src/`).
2. Run the SlackBuild:
   pacoteco-devel/slackbuilds$ sudo ./pacoteco.SlackBuild [TMP=/tmp/SBo]
   [OUTPUT=../output]
   - `TMP`: Temporary build directory (defaults to `/tmp/SBo`).
   - `OUTPUT`: Package output directory (defaults to
   `pacoteco-devel/output/`).
3. Install the package:
   pacoteco-devel/slackbuilds$ sudo installpkg
   ../output/pacoteco-1.0-noarch-1_SBo.txz

SlackBuild Details
------------------
- The script copies files from `src/pacoteco-VERSION-src/build/`
to `TMP/package-pacoteco/` staging area, mimicking FHS
paths (e.g., `usr/bin/pacoteco`, `usr/man/man8/pacoteco.8.gz`).
- It sets permissions (0755 for executables, 0644 for others).
- The `slack-desc` file is used for package description.
- The `doinst.sh` script handles post-install tasks (if any).

Common Challenges
-----------------
- **Source Files**: Ensure `build/` contains `pacoteco`,
`pacoteco.8.gz`, and `template-devel.tar.gz`, matching `appletree/`
paths.
- **Temporary Directory**: Use `TMP=/tmp/SBo` to avoid conflicts with
other builds. You may want to set `TMP=pacoteco-devel/tmp/SBo` for easy
DEBUG access

Next Steps
----------
- Read pacoteco-devel/README for general usage and installation.
- Read src/pacoteco-git/README-src for source development details.
- Customize `pacoteco.SlackBuild` if needed (e.g., for different
versions or architectures).
