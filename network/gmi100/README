gmi100 (Gemini CLI protocol client written in 100 lines of ANSI C)

I tried to pack as much as possible in 100 lines of ANSI C. Initially
I struggled to fit simple TLS connection in such small space but
eventually I ended up with CLI client capable of efficient navigation
between capsules of Gemini space.

Useful function for .profile:

```
gmi100() {
 trap : INT
 \rm /tmp/file?????? &>/dev/null
 cd && /usr/bin/gmi100 "$@"
 cd - 1>/dev/null
 trap INT
}
```

Explaining:
 * Ignore SIGINT - keyboard interrupt (\C-c);
 * Remove "temp files"¹ of gmi100;
 * 'cd' without parameter refer to "HOME shell variable"²;
 * 'cd -' goes to last directory that you stayed.

¹ all that is opened with gmi100 client
² see dash(1) or bash(1)

summa summarum: this function will does save history of gmi100 on $HOME
directory, no matter where it is running from.
