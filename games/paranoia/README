paranoia (text adventure game)

This is a very simple, but amusing, adventure game. It is based on the
role-playing game "Paranoia". It requires no instructions, as it is
self-prompting.

This game was in Slackware's y/bsdgames-1.3 package in Slackware 3.4,
but it was removed from the bsd-games source before its 2.0 release
because it's actually not a BSD game (so it's not in Slackware 3.5
and up).

paranoia was originally published in the Jan/Feb issue (No 77) of
"SpaceGamer/FantasyGamer" magazine. The license (from comments in the
source) reads: "This is a public domain adventure and may not be sold
for profit".
