# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libsrs2: libsrs2 (Sender Rewriting Scheme library)
libsrs2:
libsrs2: libsrs2 is the next generation SRS library from the original
libsrs2: designer of SRS. It implements the Sender Rewriting Scheme, a part of
libsrs2: the SPF/SRS protocol pair.
libsrs2:
libsrs2: SPF (and related systems) present a challenge to forwarders, since
libsrs2: the envelope sender address might be seen by the destination as a
libsrs2: forgery by the forwarding host. Forwarding services must rewrite the
libsrs2: envelope sender address, while encapsulating the original sender and
libsrs2: preventing relay attacks by spammers.
