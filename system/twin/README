Twin is a text-mode window environment. It turns a text terminal into
a X11-style display with window manager, terminal windows, and can
also serve as display for remote applications. Each terminal window
provides the functions of a text-mode Linux console. Twin runs on X11,
libggi, itself, the Linux console, and any termcap/ncurses-compatible
tty. It supports multiple simultaneous displays, and can attach/detach
each display on the fly.
