xxd-standalone (hex dump utility from vim)

xxd creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also
convert a hex dump back to its original binary form.

xxd is a part of vim. This standalone version can be useful for users of
neovim who want to remove the stock vim. This package is useless if vim
is installed.

Since xxd is a part of vim, xxd-standalone conflicts with the stock vim
package. You should remove vim before installing xxd-standalone.

If, by some reason, you have xxd-standalone installed simultaneously
with vim and decide to remove vim, you may need to reinstall
xxd-standalone.

If you remove xxd-standalone, you'll need to reinstall vim.
