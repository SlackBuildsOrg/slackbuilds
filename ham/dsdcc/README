Digital Speech Decoder (DSD) rewritten as a C++ library:

- A purely C++ library with a single decoder object at its central
  point
- Works by pushing new samples to the decoder at the upper level rather
  than pulling it from the underlying filesystem at the lowest level.
  This facilitates integration with software using it as a true library.
  This comes especially handy for projects in Qt that cannot afford
  using pthreads on their own like gr-dsd does. In fact the main drive
  for this is to integrate it in a plugin of SDRangel.
- Works by polling to get possible new MBE or audio samples after new
  samples have been pushed to the decoder
- Option to output audio samples as L+R (stereo) samples with L=R as
  this may facilitate integration
- A binary that uses this library is provided for integration with
  other commands that run in a shell. So basically it works only with
  input / output files possibly being stdin / stdout to be integrated
  in a pipe command. There is no direct usage of audio devices nor
  fancy side reading from or writing to .wav or .mbe files.
- mbelib usage is optional at compile time. Without mbelib only the raw
  MBE samples can be extracted to be processed outside of DSDcc with
  the help of a hardware dongle for example thus lifting the POSSIBLE
  COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS

For enabling MBE set the environment variable MBE=yes, this require
mbelib installed in your system.
