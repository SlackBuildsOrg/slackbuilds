# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pep517: python3-pep517 (API to call PEP 517 hooks)
python3-pep517:
python3-pep517: This package contains wrappers around the hooks specified by PEP 517
python3-pep517: and PEP 660. It provides:
python3-pep517:
python3-pep517: - A mechanism to call the hooks in a subprocess, so they are isolated
python3-pep517:   from the current process.
python3-pep517: - Fallbacks for the optional hooks, so that frontends can call
python3-pep517:   the hooks without checking which are defined.
