mate-desktop-environment (continuation of GNOME 2)

The MATE Desktop Environment provides an intuitive and attractive
desktop environment using traditional metaphors for Linux and
other Unix-like operating systems while preserving a traditional
desktop experience.

By installing the packages listed by REQUIRES, a MATE Desktop with
similar user experience as with the xfce-install-set is obtained.

To bring even more MATE flavour to your desktop, you might want
to install additional packages from the MATE-project(provided by SBo):
-atril (document viewer)
-engrampa (file archiver)
-mate-calc (graphical calculator)
-mozo (menu editor using the freedesktop.org menu specification)
