xpsk31 is a GTK+ graphical version of lpsk31, using the same basic
signal decoding and encoding engine but controlled by the user
via the GUI. In addition it has a FFT-derived "waterfall" display
of the incoming signal and a "magniphase" display that shows the
magnitude, phase and frequency error of the psk31 signal. It has
similar QSO logging facilities and CAT control, for the FT847 and
FT857 transceivers, which can be used to tune the transceiver to the
appropriate carrier frequency by clicking on a signal trace.

By default, xpsk31 wants to install a config file into the installing
user's home directory. This has been redirected to 
/usr/share/xpsk31-$VERSION/xpsx31rc and can be installed
from there into ~/xpsk31/.
