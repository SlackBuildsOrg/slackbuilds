Claws Mail has a high number of configurable options and, in order
to keep the binary small and fast, some of these preferences which
are not widely used are not provided with a graphical interface for
inspection and/or modification. Users wanting to edit such preferences
had to face editing the configuration text files directly; now it is
possible to do so with a convenient GTK2 interface using Clawsker.
