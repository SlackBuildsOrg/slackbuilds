libwmf-type1-fonts (URW base 35 postscript fonts for libwmf)

These Type 1 fonts are required for Slackware's libwmf package to be
able to render text. They're installed to /usr/share/libwmf/fonts, so
they're not available for other uses.

Installing this package allows Slackware's Gimp to be able to display
WMF (Windows MetaFiles) with embedded text, instead of giving an error
message when it tries. It also allows qiv (from SBo) to display them.
