# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-String-Format: perl-String-Format (sprintf-like string formatting)
perl-String-Format:
perl-String-Format: String::Format lets you define arbitrary printf-like format sequences
perl-String-Format: to be expanded. This module would be most useful in configuration
perl-String-Format: files and reporting tools, where the results of a query need to be
perl-String-Format: formatted in a particular way. It was inspired by mutt's index_format
perl-String-Format: and related directives.
