This is an improved version of Warzone 2100, a 3D science fiction
real time strategy game developed by Pumpkin Studios and published
by Eidos Interactive in 1999.

Warzone 2100 offers campaign, tutorial, multi-player and single-player
skirmish game modes, unit designer, unit experience system, and
everything you would expect from a modern RTS game.

The 3.x series does not transfer the 2.3 series saved games.

If you wish to include the animated movies, read the README.movies
