cfgparse is a more convenient, flexible, and powerful module for
parsing configuration files than the standard library ConfigParser
module. cfgparse uses a more declarative style modelled after the
popular optparse standard library module.

cfgparse can optionally cooperate with the optparse module to provide
coordination between command line and configuration file options. In
addition, the cooperation can be used to allow the user to control
features of the parser from the command line.
