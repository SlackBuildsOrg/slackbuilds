Redict is an advanced key-value store.
It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile, and values
can be strings, exactly like in memcached, but also lists, sets, and
ordered sets.
These data types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop
elements, add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection,
difference between sets, and so forth.
Redict supports different kinds of sorting abilities.

Redict is a fork of Redis after licence went proprietary.

Default port for starting the instance can be set with
REDICT_PORT=16379
Defaults remains the Redis port at 6379, hence making it incompatible
out-of-the-package with a parallel Redis instance running.

redict-cli is (for now) fully compatible with redis-cli, and defaults
to redis port 6379.

Default directory and files are setup with redict name:
/var/lib/redict for data
/var/log/redict for logs
/etc/rc.d/rc.redict for RC script
