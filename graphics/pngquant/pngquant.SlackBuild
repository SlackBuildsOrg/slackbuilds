# 20230701 bkw: Modified by SlackBuilds.org, BUILD=2:
# - strip binary and shared lib.
# - remove INSTALL from doc dir (compile instructions only).
# - add README note saying OPENMP=yes is broken.
#
# Note: upstream switched from C to Rust. The last C release was
# 2.18.0 (Feb 3, 2023), which this build should probably be updated
# for (assuming it doesn't break imgmin or tuxpaint, which depend on
# this).
#
# The 3.0.x releases don't look like they're API compatible. I would
# rather stab myself in the eye with a rusty fork than deal with Rust,
# but someone might want to look into 3.0.x (possibly as a separate
# SlackBuild, leaving this one at 2.18.0).
