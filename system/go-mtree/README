go-mtree provides the `gomtree` utility that is in likeness to
BSD mtree(3) support for Linux features like xattrs. Providing
passive filesystem vaildation and even ability to restore mode,
mtimes and xattrs from a manifest.
Tar archives can be used to generate an mtree manifest, and
then validate the files present on a filesystem, or vice versa.

See /usr/doc/go-mtree-*/README.md for examples.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
