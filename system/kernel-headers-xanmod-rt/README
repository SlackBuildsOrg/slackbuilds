This is the headers for the kernel-generic-xanmod-rt package

You only need this for wine fsync and winesync.

ALL OTHER SOFTWARE EXCEPT WINE SHOULD BE BUILD WITH SLACKWARE'S
DEFAULT HEADERS! NOT DOING SO COULD DAMAGE YOU SLACKWARE INSTALLATION!

Don't forget to remove kernel-headers installed from slackware.com
before you install. If you forget, uninstall all headers packages
and reinstall from slackware.com

Use the package in this order

removepkg kernel-headers
then install kernel-headers-xanmod-rt
then build wine-tkg
then removepkg kernel-headers-xanmod-rt
then reinstall kernel-headers
